Synchronous bone metastases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma are extremely difficult to diagnose because clinical and radiological features are not specific. In addition, the range of differential diagnoses is very wide, including metastatic carcinoma and osteosarcoma. At present, all but three published cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma with bone metastases showed bone metastases during follow-up. We confirm in our two cases that the distinct pattern of immunohistochemical staining for MUC4, associated with the absence of staining for both SATB2, a marker of osteoblastic differentiation, and pan-cytokeratin, allows differentiating between sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma and metastatic carcinoma or osteosarcoma.;"[Righi, A.; Gambarotti, M.; Benini, S.; Gamberi, G.; Cocchi, S.; Picci, P.; Vanel, D.; Dei Tos, A.

It typically affects middle-age adults with a predilection for the lower extremity. It is believed that SEF is closely related to low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), both tumors show overlapping features in morphology, immunophenotype, and molecular profile.

Here, we describe the molecular genetic alterations and histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of a primary SEF arising in the retroperitoneum. The tumor consisted of uniform small round to ovoid epithelioid cells, arranged in nests and cords and surrounded by a prominent hyalinized collagenous matrix. The tumor cells expressed only vimentin. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells showed features of fibroblasts, with an abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Neither p53 gene mutations nor p53 protein overexpression were detected, but more than 70% of all tumor cells showed strong immunoreactivity with murine double minute 2 (MDM2). Our results suggest that MDM2 overexpression is likely to play a role in tumorigenesis in this lesion in p53-dependent or p53-independent pathways.

It is characterized by epithelioid cells arranged in nests and single-file cords within a sclerotic stromal background which may mimic neoplastic bone. SEF harbors an EWSR1 translocation, which may complicate its distinction from Ewing sarcoma in cases with histomorphologic overlap. We present a diagnostically challenging case of SEF in the mandible of a 16-year-old girl. Our experience highlights the lack of specificity of traditional morphology and EWSR1 break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization. Open-ended RNA-based fusion gene testing coupled with MUC4 immunohistochemistry aided the eventual diagnosis in this case. Herein, we report the third case of SEF with EWSR1-CREB3L3 translocation and show that this fusion leads to aberrant upregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway in heterologous cell models.;"[Shenoy, Archana] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Surrey, Lea; Pogoriler, Jennifer] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Pathol Immunol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jain, Payal; Straka, Joshua; Resnick, Adam; Waanders, Angela] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Data Driven Discovery Biomed, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Foster, Jessica; Bagatell, Rochelle] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Oncol Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Waanders, Angela] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Luo, Minjie; Li, Marilyn] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Genom Diagnost, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kazahaya, Ken] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kazahaya, Ken] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Clin Otorhinolaryngol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wojcik, John] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA";"State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania";Shenoy, A (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Pathol, Coll Med, 1600 SW Archer Rd, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.;ashenoy@ufl.edu;"Surrey, Lea/HHS-2541-2022; Pogoriler, Jennifer/AGK-0523-2022";"Surrey, Lea/0000-0002-6944-2232; Pogoriler, Jennifer/0000-0001-9366-4401; Jain, Payal/0000-0002-5914-9083; Foster, Jessica/0000-0002-8001-5960; Resnick, Adam/0000-0003-0436-4189";Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium;Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium;The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium.;;20;11;11;0;4;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1093-5266;1615-5742;;PEDIATR DEVEL PATHOL;Pediatr.

To date, 110 cases have been reported; only 15 originated within the abdomen. With only 2 cases reported parallel to our study and one case briefly mentioned in a previous series, primary renal SEF is exceptionally rare but might be underrecognized. We herein describe 2 cases affecting a 23-year-old woman and a 43-year-old man. Tumor size was 22 and 4.2 cm, respectively. Patient 1 developed skeletal and multiple pulmonary metastases. She died of disease 82 months later, despite aggressive multimodality therapy. Patient 2 has no evidence of recurrence or metastasis (8 months after surgery). Histologic examination showed similar appearance with monotonous bland medium-sized epithelioid cells with rounded slightly vesicular nuclei and clear cytoplasm imparting a carcinoma-like appearance set within a highly sclerotic hyaline fibrous stroma. The tumor cells were arranged in nests, single cell cords, trabeculae, or solid sheets with frequent entrapment of renal tubules and glomeruli. Immunohistochemistry showed strong expression of vimentin, bcl2, CD99, and MUC4, whereas cytokeratin and other markers were negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a translocation involving the EWSR1 gene locus in case 2. Molecular analysis in case 1 was not successful due to poor signal quality. To our knowledge, this is the second report documenting primary renal SEF. Awareness of this entity would help avoid misinterpretation as clear cell carcinoma, sclerosing perivascular epithelioid cell tumor, Xp.11 translocation carcinoma, and other more frequent neoplasms at this site.

Even more rare are cases of SEF that show morphologic overlap with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). Such hybrid lesions arising within the bone have only rarely been reported in the literature. Due to their variegated histomorphology and non-specific radiologic features, these tumors may pose diagnostic difficulties. Herein we describe three molecularly confirmed primary bone cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma that demonstrated prominent areas showing the features of LGFMS and with areas resembling so-called hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes (HSCTGR). Two patients were female and one was male aged 26, 47, and 16, respectively. The tumors occurred in the femoral head, clavicle, and temporal bone. Imaging studies demonstrated relatively well-circumscribed radiolucent bone lesions with enhancement on MRI. Cortical breakthrough and soft tissue extension were present in one case. Histologically the tumors all demonstrated hyalinized areas with SEF-like morphology as well as spindled and myxoid areas with LGFMS-like morphology. Two cases demonstrated focal areas with rosette-like architecture as seen in HSCTGR. The tumors were all positive for MUC4 by immunohistochemistry and cytogenetics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization, and next-generation sequencing studies identified EWSR1 gene rearrangements confirming the diagnosis in all three cases.Hybrid SEF is exceedingly rare as a primary bone tumor and can be difficult to distinguish from other low-grade spindled and epithelioid lesions of bone. MUC4 positivity and identification of underlying EWSR1 gene rearrangements help support this diagnosis and exclude other tumor types.;"[Suster, David I.

To our knowledge, the present case is the first to be reported in English literature for a primary SEF of the stomach with a rareFUS-CREMfusion. We report a case of gastric SEF in a 35-year-old female who presented with nonspecific symptoms, including night sweat, cough, and iron deficiency anemia for the past few months. Further workup showed, on computed tomography, a large, heterogeneously enhancing and centrally necrotic left upper quadrant mass, which measured approximately 8.4 cm. A laparoscopic partial gastrectomy with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed. Histological examination and immunohistochemical staining suggested the diagnosis of primary gastric SEF, which was later confirmed by sarcoma fusion panel showingFUS-CREMfusion.

Subsequently, it was discovered to carry the recurrent chromosomal translocation t(7;16)(q33;p11) encoding a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion oncoprotein. Molecular tests for this pathognomonic gene fusion can confirm the identity of histologic variants (such as hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes) and suggest that some cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma may represent a high-grade version of this entity. We present a case of an ossifying tumor of the perineum that required an open biopsy and fluorescent in situ hybridization testing for FUS and CREB3L2 for diagnosis as a variant of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. Subsequent excision revealed characteristic areas with collagen rosettes as well as foci of heterotopic ossification. Significant ossification, which is well documented in entities such as synovial sarcoma, ossifying fibromyxoid tumor, and extraskeletal osteosarcoma, has not been reported previously in low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. This case demonstrates the value of having a distinctive confirmatory molecular pathology test for diagnosis and expands our knowledge of the histologic variants. possible in low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.

The overwhelming majority of tumors arise in soft tissues; however, rare cases have been documented to occur primarily in bone. The hallmarks of soft tissue SEF include MUC4 immunoreactivity and the presence of an EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. Rare cases with alternative fusions have also been reported such as EWSR1-CREB3L2 and FUS-CREB3L2 transcripts. The molecular alterations of skeletal SEF have not been well-defined, with only rare cases analyzed to date. In this study we investigated the clinicopathologic and molecular features of seven patients presenting with primary osseous SEF. There were 3 males and 4 females, with a mean age at diagnosis of 38 years. All cases had microscopic features within the histologic spectrum of SEF and showed strong and diffuse MUC4 positivity, while lacking SATB2 expression. However, due to its unusual presentation within bone, four cases were initially misinterpreted as either osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma or chondroblastoma. Half of the patients with follow-up data developed metastasis. The cases were tested by targeted RNA sequencing, MSK-IMPACT, and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization, showing EWSR1-CREB3L1 in six cases and EWSR1-CREB3L2 in one case. The fusion transcripts were composed of EWSR1 exon 11 to either exon 6 of CREB3L1 or CREB3L2. In summary, due to their rarity in the bone, skeletal SEF are often misdiagnosed, resulting in inadequate treatment modalities. Similar to their soft tissue counterpart, bone SEF follow an aggressive clinical behavior and show similar EWSR1-CREB3L1/CREB3L2 fusions.";"[Tsuda, Yusuke; Sung, Yun-Shao; Zhang, Lei; Antonescu, Cristina R.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Dickson, Brendan C.; Swanson, David] Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Dry, Sarah M.] UCLA Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Federman, Noah] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Federman, Noah] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Suurmeijer, Albert J.

Both patients had a mass in the upper part of the left kidney without any primary extrarenal neoplastic lesions. Grossly, the tumors were solid masses both measuring 7.5 cm in the greatest diameter. Histologically, one of the lesions exhibited a predominantly lobular growth of round or oval small uniform epithelioid cells in variable cellularity. Circular zones of crowded tumor cells alternating with hypocellular collagenous tissue in a concentric fashion around entrapped native renal tubules were distinctive. The second case was distinctive with significant cytological atypia in the neoplastic cells and prominent reactive proliferations in the trapped renal tubules. Immunohistochemically, vimentin, bcl-2 and MUC4 were diffusely positive in both. They were negative for S-100 protein, CD34, and desmin, whereas CD99 were positive in one lesion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay using dual staining probes detected EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion in each lesion, which is characteristic molecular findings of SEF.

This tumor frequently harbors translocation between EWSR1 and CREB3 subfamily members. Here, we describe four cases of SEF with unique genetic characteristics in children. All tumors were located in the deep soft tissue of the trunk and celom. Histopathologically, the tumors were featured by prominent hyalinized sclerotic collagenous stroma within which relatively bland and monomorphic epithelioid cells were arranged in cords, nests, or sheets. Low-grade fibmmyxoid sarcoma-like zones varied among cases. MUC4 was strong and diffuse. CD99 was positive. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated spindle or polyhedral neoplastic cells with a collagen fiber-rich stroma. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed local amplification of the EWSR1 locus. Whole-genome sequencing indicated translocation between EWSR1 and CREB3L1 together with low-level amplification of the fusion parts. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the fusion transcript. Single nudeotide polymorphism and FISH analyses demonstrated co-deletion of 11p and 22q. The consistent genetic features indicated the presence of a unique molecular variant of SEF.

Rare soft tissue sarcomas containingKMT2Afusions have recently been reported, characterized by a predilection for young adults, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like morphology, and an often aggressive course. Nonetheless, clinicopathologic and molecular descriptions ofKMT2A-rearranged sarcomas remain limited. In this study, we identified by targeted next-generation RNA sequencing an index patient withKMT2Afusion-positive soft tissue sarcoma. In addition, we systematically searched forKMT2Astructural variants in a comprehensive genomic profiling database of 14,680 sarcomas interrogated by targeted next-generation DNA and/or RNA sequencing. We characterized the clinicopathologic and molecular features ofKMT2Afusion-positive sarcomas, includingKMT2Abreakpoints, rearrangement partners, and concurrent genetic alterations. Collectively, we identified a cohort of 34 sarcomas withKMT2Afusions (0.2%), andYAP1was the predominant partner (n = 16 [47%]). Notably, a complex rearrangement withYAP1consistent withYAP1-KMT2A-YAP1fusion was detected in most cases, with preservation ofKMT2ACxxC-binding domain in theYAP1-KMT2A-YAP1fusion and concurrent deletions of corresponding exons inKMT2A. The tumors often affected younger adults (age 20-66 [median 40] years) and histologically showed variably monomorphic epithelioid-to-spindle shaped cells embedded in a dense collagenous stroma. Ultrastructural evidence of fibroblastic differentiation was noted in one tumor examined. Our cohort also included two sarcomas withVIM-KMT2Afusions, each harboring concurrent mutations inCTNNB1,SMARCB1, andARID1Aand characterized histologically by sheets of spindle-to-round blue cells. The remaining 16KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas in our cohort exhibited diverse histologic subtypes, each with unique novel fusion partners. In summary,KMT2A-fusion-positive sarcomas most commonly exhibit sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like morphology and complexYAP1-KMT2A-YAP1fusions. Cases also include rare spindle-to-round cell sarcomas withVIM-KMT2Afusions and tumors of diverse histologic subtypes with uniqueKMT2Afusions to non-YAP1non-VIMpartners.;"[Massoth, Lucas R.; Hung, Yin P.; Nardi, Valentina; Nielsen, G.

Even neoplasms with no metastatic potential may provide significant therapeutic challenges in this region due to the unique anatomy of the head and neck. This review will cover the following entities, highlighting important clinical aspects of each neoplasm and then focusing on their characteristic histomorphology, immunophenotype, and molecular alterations: nodular and cranial fasciitis, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, nuchal-type and Gardner fibromas, desmoid fibromatosis, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and giant cell fibroblastoma, solitary fibrous tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. While some of these neoplasms characteristically arise in the head and neck, others are rarely described in this anatomic region and may therefore be particularly difficult to recognize.

Heretofore, fusion transcripts were mainly detected in frozen tissues, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In this study, we aimed to develop a reliable method to detect these in paraffin -embedded tissues, and to examine the clinicopathologic characteristics of a series of translocation-positive LGFMS. Sixty-three neoplasms with typical morphologic features of LGFMS and 66 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors) were examined. RNA of sufficient quality could be extracted from 111/129 (86%) cases (59 LGFMS, 52 non-LGFMS). Of all, 48/ 59 (sensitivity, 81 %) LGFMS contained detectable transcripts (45 FUS-CREB3L2, 3 FUS-CREB3L1). Most relevant clinicopathologic features of fusion-positive LGFMS included predominance in lower extremities (22/48; thigh: 13/48), deep situation (46/48), and occasional presence of unusual histologic features, for example, hypercellular areas (16/48), foci of epithelioid cells (13/48), and giant rosettes (6/48). Most tumors expressed EMA (41/45), at least focally, CD99 (38/41) and bcl-2 (36/41) while being essentially negative for CD34 (2/45), mdm2 (1/41), smooth muscle actin (1/45), S100 protein (0/46), desmin (0/44), h-caldesmon (0/42), keratins (0/44), and CD 117 (0/40). Eleven presumed LGFMS were fusion negative. Of all, 7/52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained FUS-CREB3L2 transcripts, of which 4 had been diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. In conclusion, FUS-CRE133LI/L2 fusion transcripts can be detected in paraffin-embedded LGFMS in a sensitive manner, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Most fusion-positive LGFMS are EMA-positive and CD34/S100/smooth muscle actin negative.

The present study examines the diagnostic capacities of mucin-4 (MUC4), a transmembrane mucin, in identifying different types of sarcomas and broadens its evaluation to include a wide range of sarcomas.Methods Immunohistochemical (IHC) examination of tissue samples from various sarcomas was performed using a mouse anti-MUC4 monoclonal antibody. IHC was conducted on 4-mm thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections after pressure cooker antigen retrieval with a mouse anti-MUC4 monoclonal antibody.Results MUC4 was shown to be highly expressed in SEF (n=13) and LGFMS (n=10), while focal positivity in synovial sarcoma (n=1). Other sarcomas, such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma, exhibited no expression (n=0). These findings are consistent with previous research and support MUC4 specificity as a SEF and LGFMS marker. This study provides information on the diagnostic efficacy of MUC4, particularly in the context of certain subtypes. It not only helps our understanding of these unique instances, but it also provides context for histopathological and IHC findings in soft tissue sarcoma. Furthermore, this study investigates the influence of age and gender on MUC4 expression in a range of sarcomas, which was typically understudied in the literature and found no relation with expression of MUC4.Conclusion In conclusion, this study adds to our understanding of soft tissue sarcomas by emphasizing the crucial role of MUC4 in certain sarcoma subtypes while acknowledging the complex variety of the sarcoma landscape. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanism that governs marker expression patterns, as well as the therapeutic implications.;"[Hassan, Usman; Sr, Saad M.

Subsequent studies suggested that the presence of low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS)-like zones, occasional FUS gene rearrangements, and immunoreactivity for MUC4 all pointed to a close inter-relationship with LGFMS; however, more recent studies showed that SEF is genetically distinct from LGFMS with predominantly EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion and complex secondary genomic alterations. To better understand the relationship between these tumors, we studied 51 cases of SEF, the largest reported series to date, and directly compared them to a previously published series of LGFMS from the same institution. The male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1 with a median age of 45 years. Tumors occurred primarily in the lower extremity (12), intra-abdominal area/visceral organs (9) and chest wall/paraspinal region (9) with a median size of 8.2 cm. The median follow-up was 49 months in 45 patients: 12 developed local recurrences and 36 developed metastases, mainly to lung and bone. Molecular studies showed EWSR1 gene rearrangement in 13 cases, 3 ' deletion of EWSR1 in 6, monosomy for EWSR1 in 2; FUS gene rearrangements in 3; EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion in 7; EWSR1-CREB3L2 fusion in 1; and YAP1-KMT2A fusion in 2. Overall survival of SEF was significantly less compared with LGFMS (P <= 0.0001).

The majority of LGFMS are characterized by a recurrent (7;16)(q34;p11) translocation, resulting in the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene, which generates a chimeric protein with transcriptional regulatory activity. Small numbers harbor a FUS-CREB3L1 fusion resulting from t (11;16)(p11;p11), whilst rare cases harbor the EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. LGFMS is of low to moderate cellularity and consists of bland spindle cells with small, angulated nuclei and scant, wispy cytoplasm, arranged in a whorled growth pattern and typically showing abrupt transition from myxoid to fibrous areas. Immunohistochemical expression of MUC4 is a consistent finding. Hyalinized spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes (HSCTGR) is a morphological variant of LGFMS that shares the same balanced translocation, and is also immunoreactive for MUC4. A potential relationship between LGFMS and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF), a rare fibroblastic neoplasm that most commonly arises in the deep soft tissues of the lower extremities, limb girdles or trunk, has also been suggested. SEF is classically composed of nests and cords of epithelioid cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm embedded within densely sclerotic stroma. In some cases, areas indistinguishable from LGFMS are present, and these have been shown to contain FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts. The majority of pure SEF tumors harbor EWSR1 rearrangements, with EWSR1-CREB3L1 and more rarely EWSRI-CREB3L2 gene fusions more common than those involving FUS. MUC4 immunoreactivity is also seen in approximately 70% of SEF. Surgical resection of these tumors with clear margins is the treatment of choice. Correct diagnosis is important because of the significant potential for recurrence and late metastatic spread. We review LGFMS and SEF, discussing morphology and immunohistochemistry, genetics and molecular findings, and the differential diagnosis.";"[Mohamed, Mustafa; Thway, Khin] Royal Marsden Hosp, Sarcoma Unit, London, England";Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust;Thway, K (corresponding author), Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Sarcoma Unit, 203 Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JJ, England.;khin.thway@rmh.nhs.uk;;;NIHR Royal Marsden/ICR Biomedical Research Centre;NIHR Royal Marsden/ICR Biomedical Research Centre;We acknowledge support from the NIHR Royal Marsden/ICR Biomedical Research Centre.;;98;62;67;0;15;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;1092-9134;1532-8198;;ANN DIAGN PATHOL;Ann.

METHODS A computerized search for fluid cytology with a sarcoma diagnosis from 2000 to 2020 was performed. All available cases, including the clinical follow-up, were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 57 fluids specimens from 36 BSTSs were identified (9 rhabdomyosarcomas, 6 angiosarcomas, 5 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, 3 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 2 chondrosarcomas, 1 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, 3 Ewing sarcomas, 2 undifferentiated sarcomas, 3 osteosarcomas, 1 synovial sarcoma, and 1 hybrid low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma/sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma). There were 22 males and 14 females. The age range was 4 to 82 years (median, 45 years). Sites of involvement included pleural fluid (n = 38), peritoneal fluid (n = 14), and CSF (n = 5). Twenty-four cytology cases were available for review. The cytologic features were nonspecific and ranged from dyshesive to clusters of round, epithelioid, pleomorphic, and occasionally spindle-shaped malignant cells that could easily mimic other non-BSTS malignant tumors. The diagnosis of BSTS was made by comparison with a prior specimen and/or ancillary studies (molecular or immunohistochemical stains). The prognosis was poor because 95% of the patients died of their disease. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of BSTS in fluid cytology is extremely rare, and it can have cytologic features similar to those of non-BSTS malignancies. Although, in most cases, a comparison with a prior known BSTS specimen may suffice, the use of ancillary studies is extremely helpful in arriving at the correct diagnosis. However, in cases with no known prior malignancy, including BSTS in the differential diagnosis is prudent for preventing misdiagnosis.;"[Sharma, Anurag; Shetty, Sindhu; Policarpio-Nicolas, Maria Luisa C.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Lab Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Thangaiah, Judith Jebastin] Mayo Clin, Dept Pathol, Rochester, MN USA";"Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Mayo Clinic";Policarpio-Nicolas, MLC (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Dept Pathol, Robert J Tomsich Pathol & Lab Med Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.;polinico2000@yahoo.com;;;;;;;29;5;5;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1934-662X;1934-6638;;CANCER CYTOPATHOL;Cancer Cytopathol.;OCT;2021;129;10;;;;;776;787;;10.1002/cncy.22431;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cncy.22431;;JUL 2021;12;"Oncology; Pathology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Oncology; Pathology";UZ9CU;34233079;Bronze;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000670337900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

These lesions are diagnostically challenging because of morphologic and immunohistochemical overlap, despite significant clinical, genetic, and prognostic differences. The fibromatoses are a major subgroup, and all types of fibromatoses can occur in the 1st 2 decades of life. Intermediate and malignant fibroblastic-myofibroblastic tumors are an important group that includes variants of fibrosarcoma and other tumors with recurrent cytogenetic or molecular genetic abnormalities and low metastatic potential. Pathologic examination is enhanced by adjunct techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics, although morphology provides the ultimate criteria for a specific diagnosis.

We report on the nationwide exhaustive series of 330 patients with SEF or LGFMS in NETSARC+ since 2010.Patients and methods: NETSARC (netsarc.org) is a network of 26 reference sarcoma centers with specialized multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTB). Since 2010, (i) pathological review has been mandatory for sarcoma, and (ii) tumour/patients' characteristics have been collected in the NETSARC+ nationwide database. The characteristics of patients with SEF and LGFMS and their outcome are compared.Results: 35/73 (48%) and 125/257(49%) of patients with SEF and LGFMS were female. More visceral, bone and trunk primary sites were observed in SEF (p < 0.001). 30% of SEF vs 4% of LGFMS patients had metastasis at diagnosis (p < 0.0001). Median size of the primary tumor was 51 mm (range 10-90) for LGFMS vs 80 (20-320) for SEF (p < 0.001). Median age for LGFMS patients was 12 years younger than that of SEF patients (43 [range 4-98] vs 55 [range 10-91], p < 0.001). Neoadjuvant treatment was more often given to SEF (16% vs 9%, p = 0.05). More patients with LGFMS were operated first in reference centers (51% vs 26%, p < 0.001). The R0 rate on the operative specimen was 41% in LGFMS vs 16% in SEF (p < 0.001). Median event-free survival (EFS) of patients with SEF and LGFMS were 32 vs 136 months (p < 0.0001). The median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Fifty-months OS was 93% vs 81% for LGFMS vs SEF (p = 0.05). Median OS was 77 months after first relapse, similar for SEF and LGFMS.In multivariate analysis, age, tumor size, metastasis at diagnosis were independent prognostic factors for OS in LGFMS.Conclusions: Although sharing close molecular alterations, SEF and LGFMS have a different natural history, clinical presentation and outcome, with a higher risk of metastatic relapse in SEF. Survival after relapse is longer than with other sarcomas, and similar for SEF and LGFMS.;"[Blay, J.

It is an unusual variant of fibro-sarcoma that commonly arises in the soft tissues of the limb, head and neck, trunk and occasionally in the visceral organs and bones. This entity is commonly reported in the middle age group, men and women alike. Pathological clinchers include MUC 4 (Mucin 4, cell surface associated) positivity by immunohistochemistry, FUS-CREB3L1 fusion and EWSR1 rearrangement. This disease is notoriously known for its local recurrence and metastatic spread. Response to systemic therapy is poor and relapses are frequent. The role of targeted and immunotherapy is not well defined.Case presentation: Here we report a 46-year-old gentleman who presented to the Sarcoma Medical Oncology Clinic in our centre. He had primary involvement of right pubic bone with metastasis to liver, lung and diffuse lytic bony lesions. His diagnosis was reviewed multiple times before coming to final diagnosis of SEF. His molecular test for EWSR1 rearrangement was positive by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. He did not respond to palliative doxorubicin, pazopanib and gemcitabine and docetaxel.Conclusion: Through this case report, we would like to highlight the rarity of this sarcoma, its classical pathological features, its close relationship to low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and the limited therapeutic options available. Hence, there is a need for further research in this entity.;"[Santhosh, Akhil; Rastogi, Sameer] All India Inst Med Sci, BRA IRCH, Dept Med Oncol, New Delhi 110029, India; [Mehta, Jay; Barwad, Adarsh] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Pathol, New Delhi 110029, India; [Shamim, Shamim A.] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Nucl Med, New Delhi 110029, India";"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi";Rastogi, S (corresponding author), All India Inst Med Sci, BRA IRCH, Dept Med Oncol, New Delhi 110029, India.;samdoc_mamc@yahoo.com;;;;;;;12;1;1;0;0;CANCER INTELLIGENCE LTD;BRISTOL;11 ALMA VALE RD,, BRISTOL, BS8 2HL, ENGLAND;1754-6605;;;ECANCERMEDICALSCIENC;eCancerMedicalScience;SEP 20;2022;16;;;;;;;;1446;10.3332/ecancer.2022.1446;http://dx.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2022.1446;;;6;Oncology;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Oncology;5C7NE;36405948;Green Published, gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000864441800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Only four cases have been previously reported. The aim of this article is to report six additional cases of this unusual mesenchymal neoplasm, with an emphasis on its differential diagnosis. Methods and results The six cases were from three females and three males (age, 20-49 years; median, 42 years). Three tumours were located on the abdominal wall; two from the shoulder/axillary areas, and one on the lateral hip. All presented as slow-growing subcutaneous nodules, ranging from 26 to 55 mm (median, 40 mm). The tumours consisted of circumscribed, variably cellular nodules composed of relatively bland plump spindled to epithelioid cells arranged singly, in cords, and occasionally in nests, embedded in hyalinised and collagenous stroma. Small hypocellular myxoid zones with ropey collagen fibres were present, as were irregularly dilated, gaping, crescent-shaped or staghorn-like thin-walled vessels, best appreciated at the periphery. Immunohistochemistry for CD34, S100, MUC4 and STAT6 was consistently negative. RNA-sequencing revealed PRRX1-NCOA1 fusions in all cases. Of the four cases with limited follow-up (1.5-4 months), none recurred following local surgical excision. Conclusions The morphological features of PRRX1-NCOA1-rearranged fibroblastic tumour overlap with those of RB1-deficient soft-tissue tumours, solitary fibrous tumour, and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma/sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. This differential diagnosis can be resolved with a combination of careful morphological study and the application of a panel of immunostains, although molecular genetic study is most definitive. The natural history of PRRX1-NCOA1-rearranged fibroblastic tumour appears to be quite favourable, although longer-term study of a larger number of cases is warranted.";"[Dermawan, Josephine K.; Azzato, Elizabeth M.; Gjorgova-Gjeorgievski, Sandra; Rubin, Brian P.; Fritchie, Karen J.] Cleveland Clin, Robert J Tomsich Pathol & Lab Med Inst, 2119 E 93rd St,L15, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Thangaiah, Judith Jebastin; Folpe, Andrew L.] Mayo Clin, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Rochester, MN USA; [Agaimy, Abbas] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Inst Pathol, Erlangen, Germany";"Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Mayo Clinic; University of Erlangen Nuremberg";Fritchie, KJ (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Robert J Tomsich Pathol & Lab Med Inst, 2119 E 93rd St,L15, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.;fritchk@ccf.org;Azzato, Elizabeth/N-4472-2018;Dermawan, Josephine Kam Tai/0000-0002-1139-2914;;;;;28;11;11;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0309-0167;1365-2559;;HISTOPATHOLOGY;Histopathology;DEC;2021;79;6;;;;;997;1003;;10.1111/his.14454;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/his.14454;;SEP 2021;7;"Cell Biology; Pathology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Cell Biology; Pathology";XM0ZA;34272753;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000692461900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, both SEF and LGFMS show MUC4 expression by immunohistochemistry. While the majority of LGFMS cases are characterized by a FUS-CREB3L1 fusion, both FUS-CREB3L2 and EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusions were recently demonstrated in a small number of LGFMS and SEF/LGFMS hybrid tumors. In contrast, recent studies pointed out that SEF harbor frequent EWSR1 rearrangements, with only a minority of cases showing FUS-CREB3L2 fusions. In an effort to further characterize the molecular characteristics of pure SEF and hybrid SEF/LGFMS lesions, we undertook a clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and genetic analysis of a series of 10 SEF and 8 hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors. The mortality rate was similar between the two groups, 44% within the pure SEF group and 37% in the hybrid SEF/LGFMS with a mean overall follow-up of 66 months. All but one pure SEF and all hybrid SEF/LGFMS-tested cases showed MUC4 immunoreactivity. The majority (90%) of pure SEF cases showed EWSR1 gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization with only one case exhibiting FUS rearrangement. Of the nine EWSR1 positive cases, six cases harbored CREB3L1 break-apart, two had CREB3L2 rearrangement (a previously unreported finding) and one lacked evidence of CREB3L1/2 abnormalities. In contrast, all hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors exhibited FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements. These results further demarcate a relative cytogenetic dichotomy between pure SEF, often characterized by EWSR1 rearrangements, and hybrid SEF/LGFMS, harboring FUS-CREB3L2 fusion; the latter group recapitulating the genotype of LGFMS.

Furthermore, this is particularly true for the subset termed Ewing-like undifferentiated round cell sarcomas in which new translocations have been reported since the fourth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours of Soft Tissue and Bone. Amid this expanding genetic landscape, we report a case of extraskeletal undifferentiated round cell Ewing-like sarcoma in a 27-year-old female. The patient presented with a large lung mass accompanied on staging imaging by deposits suspicious for metastatic disease in the humerus, calvarium, and lymph nodes of the neck and chest. Biopsy of the lung mass revealed a densely packed monotonous proliferation of round, uniform neoplastic cells with scant cytoplasm. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for CD99, synaptophysin, TLE1, EMA, and MUC4 and negative for FLI1, PAX7, AE1/3, S100, SOX10, WT1, p63, desmin, and HMB45. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated rearrangement of the EWSR1 gene. Next-generation sequencing based assay revealed an EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. Taken together, the histomorphologic and molecular findings were considered consistent with an undifferentiated round cell sarcoma with an EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. Although described in entities such as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, and small cell osteosarcoma, this has not been previously described in undifferentiated round cell (Ewing-like) sarcoma. This finding adds to the growing list of undifferentiated round cell sarcomas with Ewing-like morphologic phenotype-associated fusion genes and may contribute to further defining and characterizing the different subset of tumors in the Ewing family of tumors.;"[Bissonnette, Caroline] Ohio State Univ, Div Oral & Maxillofacial Pathol & Radiol, Coll Dent, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Shilo, Konstantin; Iwenofu, O.

The reported immunophenotype of SEF is nonspecific. Some SEF cases show morphologic and molecular overlap with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), suggesting a relationship between these tumor types. MUC4 has recently been identified as a sensitive and specific marker for LGFMS; MUC4 expression was also observed in 2 tumors with hybrid features of SEF and LGFMS. We investigated MUC4 expression in SEF and other epithelioid soft tissue tumors to determine (1) the potential diagnostic utility of MUC4 for SEF and (2) the association between MUC4 expression and FUS rearrangement in SEF. Whole sections of 180 tumors were evaluated: 41 cases of SEF (including 29 pure SEF and 12 hybrid LGFMS-SEF), 20 epithelioid sarcomas, 11 clear cell sarcomas, 11 metastatic melanomas, 10 perivascular epithelioid cell tumors, 10 alveolar soft part sarcomas, 10 epithelioid angiosarcomas, 10 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, 10 epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 10 myoepithelial carcinomas, 17 ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, 10 leiomyosarcomas, and 10 biphasic synovial sarcomas. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed after antigen retrieval using a mouse anti-MUC4 monoclonal antibody. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on 33 SEF cases using FUS break-apart probes. A subset of cases was also evaluated for EWSR1 and CREB3L2/L1 rearrangements by FISH. Strong diffuse cytoplasmic staining for MUC4 was observed in 32 of 41 (78%) cases of SEF, including all 12 hybrid tumors. FUS rearrangement was detected in 8 of 21 (38%) MUC4-positive cases of SEF with successful FISH studies. The prevalence of FUS rearrangement was similar in hybrid LGFMS-SEF (2 of 6; 33%) and SEF without an LGFMS component (6 of 15; 40%). FUS rearrangement was not detected in any cases of MUC4-negative SEF. Two hybrid tumors had both EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements. MUC4 expression was also seen in 9 of 10 (90%) biphasic synovial sarcomas, predominantly in the glandular component. All other tumor types were negative for MUC4, apart from focal reactivity in 5 ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, 2 epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and 1 myoepithelial carcinoma. MUC4 is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for SEF among epithelioid soft tissue tumors. MUC4 expression occurs more frequently than FUS rearrangement in SEF. The finding of EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements in 2 cases of hybrid LGFMS-SEF suggests that SEFs are genetically heterogenous. MUC4-positive SEFs with FUS rearrangement are likely closely related to LGFMS. MUC4-positive SEFs that lack FUS rearrangement may be related to LGFMS but could have alternate fusion partners, including EWSR1. SEF without MUC4 expression may represent a distinct group of tumors. MUC4 expression correlates with glandular epithelial differentiation in biphasic synovial sarcoma and is very limited in other epithelioid soft tissue tumors.";"[Doyle, Leona A.; Dal Cin, Paola; Fletcher, Christopher D.

No recent series has critically reevaluated putative FSs to estimate their true incidence. One hundred ninety-five cases diagnosed as adult FS in somatic soft tissue were retrieved from our institutional archives for the period 1960 to 2008. Thirty-two cases with insufficient material were excluded. On the basis the morphology of the final 163 cases, immunohistochemical studies (IHC) was conducted using some combination of: wide-spectrum cytokeratin (CK), EMA, high molecular weight CK, S100, Melan A, HMB-45, CD34, TLE1, CD31, HHV8, smooth muscle actin, desmin, ALK1, CD99, Myo-D1, myogenin, c-kit, INI1, CD21, p63, calretinin, WT1, and TTF1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for SYT gene rearrangement was done in 6 putative CK-negative synovial sarcomas (SS). Revised diagnoses were based on clinical, morphologic, IHC, and molecular findings. The original group of putative FS occurred in 84 males and 79 females (median 52.5 y, range 2 to 99 y), and involved various anatomic sites. Only 26 cases met WHO criteria for FS, including 2 postradiation FS. These occurred in 16 males and 10 females (median 50 y, range 6 to 74 y), and involved the lower extremities (12 cases), head/ neck (5 cases), trunk (4 cases), upper extremities (3 case), and mediastinum/abdomen (2 cases). Clinical follow-up information was available for 24 of 26 (92%) cases, with a median of 5 years follow-up (range < 1 to 35 y). Twelve patients (50%) died of locally aggressive and/or metastatic disease (median follow-up 1-year; range < 1 to 8 y), 6 patients (25%) were alive without disease (median follow-up 11.5 y; range 2.5 to 35 y), and 6 patients (25%) died of other causes (median follow-up 10 y; range 9 to 18 y) (Table 3). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was positive for SYT gene rearrangement in all cases tested. Non-FS (137 cases) were reclassified as: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (32 cases), SS (21 cases), solitary fibrous tumor (14 cases), myxofibrosarcoma (11 cases), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (8 cases), FS dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and desmoplastic melanoma (4 cases each), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, spindle-cell liposarcoma (3 cases each), sclerosing epithelioid FS, fibroma-like epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, cellular fibrous histiocytoma (2 cases each), and others (17 cases). Using modern diagnostic criteria with ancillary IHC and molecular genetics, we have been able to reclassify 84% of putative FS. Exclusive of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the distinction of which from FS is subjective, 64% of putative FS were reclassified, most commonly as monophasic SS and solitary fibrous tumor. We conclude that true FS is exceedingly rare, accounting for < 1% of approximately 10,000 adult soft tissue sarcomas seen at our institution during this time period, and should be diagnosed with great caution.";"[Bahrami, Armita; Folpe, Andrew L.] Mayo Clin, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA";Mayo Clinic;Folpe, AL (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.;Folpe.Andrew@Mayo.edu;Bahrami, Armita/N-3262-2018;Bahrami, Armita/0000-0002-8515-2649;;;;;58;89;92;0;7;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0147-5185;1532-0979;;AM J SURG PATHOL;Am.

To our knowledge, this novel gene fusion has not been described previously in myoepithelial carcinoma. A 46-year-old male patient presented with a mass involving the superficial left parotid gland with extension into the external auditory canal (EAC) and erosion of the conchal cartilage. Histologically, the neoplasm was composed of uniform spindled, epithelioid/ovoid cells arranged in cords and nests within hyalinized to myxoid stroma. On immunohistochemistry (IHC), the tumor cells demonstrated patchy and variable staining for low molecular weight cytokeratin (CAM5.2), pan-cytokeratin (OSCAR), and S-100. Overall, the morphological and immunohistochemical attributes supported a locally aggressive tumor of myoepithelial differentiation consistent with myoepithelial carcinoma. Molecular analysis using a custom 115-gene gene panel by targeted RNA sequencing, showed an in-frame CTCF::NCOA2 fusion.

These lesions may affect patients of any age group but are more frequently encountered in the pediatric population. Patient clinical presentation depends on the location, growth pattern, adjacent soft-tissue involvement, and pathologic behavior of these neoplasms. In the 2020 update to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, these tumors are classified on the basis of their distinct biologic behavior, histomorphologic characteristics, and molecular profiles into four tumor categories: (a) benign (eg, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, nodular fasciitis, proliferative fasciitis, fibroma of the tendon sheath, calcifying aponeurotic fibroma); (b) intermediate, locally aggressive (eg, desmoid fibromatosis); (c) intermediate, rarely metastasizing (eg, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma); and (d) malignant (eg, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas; low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma; myxofibrosarcoma; fibrosarcoma, not otherwise specified). Detection of various components of solid tumors at imaging can help in prediction of the presence of corresponding histopathologic variations, thus influencing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. For example, lesions with a greater myxoid matrix or necrotic components tend to show higher signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, whereas lesions with hypercellularity and dense internal collagen content display low signal intensity. In addition, understanding the radiologic-pathologic correlation of soft-tissue tumors can help to increase the accuracy of percutaneous biopsy and allow unnecessary interventions to be avoided.";"[Haseli, Sara; Pooyan, Atefe; Zadeh, Firoozeh Shomal; Chalian, Majid] Univ Washington, Dept Radiol, Div Musculoskeletal Imaging & Intervent, UW Radiol Roosevelt Clin, 4245 Roosevelt Way NE, Box 354755, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Mansoori, Bahar; Christensen, Diana; Abadi, Alireza] Univ Washington, Dept Radiol, UW Radiol Roosevelt Clin, Div Abdominal Imaging, 4245 Roosevelt Way NE, Box 354755, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Mansoori, Bahar] Univ Washington, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, UW Radiol Roosevelt Clin, 4245 Roosevelt Way NE, Box 354755, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Khalili, Nastaran] Universal Sci Educ & Res Network, Canc Immunol Project, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Murphey, Mark] Walter Reed Army Med Ctr, Armed Forces Inst Pathol, Dept Radiol Pathol, Washington, DC USA";"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center";Chalian, M (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Radiol, Div Musculoskeletal Imaging & Intervent, UW Radiol Roosevelt Clin, 4245 Roosevelt Way NE, Box 354755, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.;mchalian@uw.edu;;Chalian, Majid/0000-0001-8400-1593;;;;;75;1;1;2;3;RADIOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMERICA (RSNA);OAK BROOK;820 JORIE BLVD, SUITE 200, OAK BROOK, ILLINOIS, UNITED STATES;0271-5333;;;RADIOGRAPHICS;Radiographics;AUG;2023;43;8;;;;;;;e230005;10.1148/rg.230005;http://dx.doi.org/10.1148/rg.230005;;;15;Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging;P6FZ5;37440448;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001051626500002;View Full Record in Web of Science

We now report 4 molecularly confirmed cases of OFMT involving the genitourinary tract. All patients were males, ranging in age from 20 to 66 years (mean: 43 y). One case each arose in the kidney, ureter, perirenal soft tissue, and penis. All neoplasms demonstrated bland epithelioid to spindled cells set in a variably fibrous to fibromyxoid stroma, and only 1 had a peripheral shell of lamellar bone. All cases appeared well-circumscribed on gross/radiologic examination, though the primary renal neoplasm permeated between native renal tubules. By immunohistochemistry, S100 protein was negative in all 4 cases, while desmin was positive in 2 cases. In 2 cases, the Illumina TruSight RNA Fusion Panel demonstrated a PHF1::TFE3 and EP400::PHF1 fusion, respectively. In the remaining 2 cases, PHF1 gene rearrangement was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Due to unusual clinical presentation, lack of S100 positivity, and only occasional bone formation, the correct diagnosis was challenging in the absence of molecular testing. In summary, OFMT may rarely present primarily in the genitourinary tract. Given their nonspecific morphology and immunophenotype, molecular analysis is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis.;"[Argani, Pedram; Gross, John M.

Because of this complexity and the recognition of an intermediate malignancy category including some tumors with a deceptively bland histologic appearance, soft tissue tumors may represent a major diagnostic challenge to the general practicing pathologist. Objective.-To correctly diagnose soft tissue tumors with the ancillary use of immunohistochemistry. Data Sources.-Review of the current literature with emphasis on those tumors for which immunohistochemistry has proven to be particularly useful. Conclusions.-Immunohistochemistry plays an important role in the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors. One of its major utilities is to correctly identify a tumor as being of mesenchymal or nonmesenchymal origin. Once mesenchymal origin has been established, histologic subtyping according to specific cell lineage may be achieved with the use of lineage-specific markers. Tumors of uncertain cell lineage and tumors with primitive small round cell morphology are often characterized by a unique immunohistochemical phenotype. In this group of tumors, immunohistochemistry is most widely applied and is of greatest value. Despite the rapid development of molecular genetic techniques, immunohistochemistry still remains the most important diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors aside from recognition of morphologic features and clinical correlation.;"[Heim-Hall, Josefine; Yohe, Sophia L.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Pathol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA";"University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio";Heim-Hall, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Pathol, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr,Mail Code 7750, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA.;heim@uthscsa.edu;Yohe, Sophia/O-2331-2013;Yohe, Sophia/0000-0003-2235-9930;;;;;179;51;58;1;8;COLL AMER PATHOLOGISTS;NORTHFIELD;C/O KIMBERLY GACKI, 325 WAUKEGAN RD, NORTHFIELD, IL 60093-2750 USA;0003-9985;1543-2165;;ARCH PATHOL LAB MED;Arch.

We aimed to define their clinicopathologic features and whether they are characterized by recurrent molecular signatures. Eight cases were identified; studied histologically and by immunohistochemistry. Selected cases were also subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES; n = 4), RNA-sequencing (n = 6), Archer FusionPlex assay (n = 5), methylation profiling using the Illumina MethylationEPIC (850k) array platform (n = 6), and TERT promoter sequencing (n = 5). Six neoplasms occurred in females. The mean age was 43 years (range: 26-75). Five occurred in the head/neck of the pancreas. All patients were treated surgically; none received neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. All patients are free of disease after 53 months of median follow-up (range: 8-94). The tumors were well-circumscribed, and the median size was 1.8 cm (range: 1.3-5.8). Microscopically, the unencapsulated tumors had a geographic pattern of epithelioid cell nests alternating with spindle cell fascicles. Some areas showed dense fibrosis, in which enmeshed tumor cells imparted a slit-like pattern. The predominant epithelioid cells had scant cytoplasm and round-oval nuclei with open chromatin. The spindle cells displayed irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitoses were rare. No lymph node metastases were identified. All tumors were positive for vimentin, CD99 and cytokeratin (patchy), while negative for markers of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, neuroendocrine, acinar, myogenic/rhabdoid, vascular, melanocytic, or lymphoid differentiation, gastrointestinal stromal tumor as well as MUC4. Whole-exome sequencing revealed no recurrent somatic mutations or amplifications/homozygous deletions in any known oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. RNA-sequencing and the Archer FusionPlex assay did not detect any recurrent likely pathogenic gene fusions. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis revealed that these tumors display a likely mesenchymal transcriptomic program. Unsupervised analysis (t-SNE) of their methylation profiles against a set of different mesenchymal neoplasms demonstrated a distinct methylation pattern. Here, we describe pancreatic neoplasms with unique morphologic/immunophenotypic features and a distinct methylation pattern, along with a lack of abnormalities in any of key genetic drivers, supporting that these neoplasms represent a novel entity with an indolent clinical course. Given their mesenchymal transcriptomic features, we propose the designation of sclerosing epithelioid mesenchymal neoplasm of the pancreas.";"[Basturk, Olca; Weigelt, Britta; Benhamida, Jamal K.; Askan, Gokce; Wang, Lu; Arcila, Maria E.; Gularte-Merida, Rodrigo; Paula, Arnaud Da Cruz; Selenica, Pier; Kumar, Rahul; Pareja, Fresia; Yavas, Aslihan; Reis-Filho, Jorge S.; Klimstra, David S.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Adsay, Volkan] Koc Univ, Dept Pathol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Zamboni, Giuseppe] Univ Verona, Dept Pathol, Verona, Italy; [Zamboni, Giuseppe] IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hosp, Verona, Italy; [Fukushima, Noriyoshi] Jichi Med Univ, Dept Pathol, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan; [Maher, Christopher A.] Washington Univ, Dept Pathol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Scholes, John] St Francis Hosp & Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Hartford, CT USA; [Oda, Yoshinao] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Anat Pathol, Fukuoka, Japan; [Santini, Donatella] Azienda Osped Univ Bologna, Dept Pathol, Bologna, Italy; [Doyle, Leona A.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Petersen, Iver] SRH Poliklin Gera GmbH, Dept Pathol, Gera, Germany; [Flucke, Uta] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Pathol, Med Ctr, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Koelsche, Christian] Univ Hosp Heidelberg, Dept Pathol, Heidelberg, Germany; [Reynolds, Samuel J.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Pathol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [von Deimling, Andreas] Univ Hosp Heidelberg, Dept Neuropathol, Heidelberg, Germany; [von Deimling, Andreas] German Canc Res Ctr, CCU Neuropathol, Heidelberg, Germany; [Wang, Lu] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA";"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Koc University; University of Verona; IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria; Jichi Medical University; Washington University (WUSTL); Saint Francis Hospital & Medical Center; Kyushu University; University of Bologna; IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Radboud University Nijmegen; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of New Mexico; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Helmholtz Association; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ); St Jude Children's Research Hospital";Klimstra, DS (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.;klimstrd@mskcc.org;"Selenica, Pier/GQY-8678-2022; Yavas, Aslihan/HCH-6995-2022; Kölsche, Christian/Q-8854-2019; Kumar, Rahul/JZE-0734-2024; Askan, Gokce/AAR-9172-2020; Kumar, Rahul/JWO-5262-2024; Basturk, Olca/N-7214-2017; von Deimling, Andreas/F-7774-2013; Adsay, Volkan/N-7130-2017; Da Cruz Paula, Arnaud/KGM-1186-2024; kumar, rahul/GZG-2171-2022; Arcila, Maria/ABE-2235-2021; Yavas, Aslihan/ABD-1990-2021; Santini, Donatella/AAO-1490-2021; Kumar, Rahul/ABB-3530-2020; , Lu/N-8128-2018";"Kölsche, Christian/0000-0001-8763-8864; von Deimling, Andreas/0000-0002-5863-540X; Adsay, Volkan/0000-0002-1308-3701; Da Cruz Paula, Arnaud/0000-0001-7694-8760; Yavas, Aslihan/0000-0002-8408-3063; Santini, Donatella/0000-0002-1692-6348; Askan, Gokce/0000-0002-9255-649X; , Lu/0000-0002-0073-0666; Gularte Merida, Rodrigo/0000-0002-4383-2523; Kumar, Rahul/0000-0002-6927-5390";"NCI/NIH Cancer Center Support Grant [P30 CA008748]; German Cancer Aid [70112499]; Melamed Family Foundation; Breast Cancer Research Foundation";"NCI/NIH Cancer Center Support Grant; German Cancer Aid(Deutsche Krebshilfe); Melamed Family Foundation; Breast Cancer Research Foundation";This work has been supported in part by the NCI/NIH Cancer Center Support Grant P30 CA008748, by the German Cancer Aid Grant 70112499 and by the Melamed Family Foundation.

Among the genes that can be rearranged, the EWSR1 gene has been identified as a partner in a wide variety of clinically and pathologically diverse sarcomas as well as some non-mesenchymal tumours. The former include Ewing sarcoma and similar (Ewing-like) small round cell sarcomas, desmoplastic small round cell tumour, myxoid liposarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue and clear cell sarcoma-like tumours of the gastrointestinal tract, primary pulmonary myxoid sarcoma, extrasalivary myoepithelial tumours and sporadic examples of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma and mesothelioma. EWSR1 is a promiscuous' gene that can fuse with many different partner genes, but sometimes this results in phenotypically identical tumours. EWSR1 can, conversely, partner with the same genes in morphologically and behaviourally different neoplasms.

Objective.-To highlight the most important diagnostic features, including morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular findings; to provide comparisons to other entities in the differential diagnosis; and to provide a summary of the clinical features and outcomes in cases reported to date. Data Sources.-The data sources include recently published literature encompassing OFMT and tumors in the histologic differential diagnosis, and cases from institutional files. Conclusions.-Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor is important to recognize because of its low-grade morphology but potential for recurrence and metastasis. Recent molecular analysis has expanded the morphologic spectrum of OFMT, with additional cases discovered that are enriched for aggressive behavior. The diagnosis can often be rendered through a combination of morphology and coexpression of S100 protein and desmin, although only a minority of cases described contain all of these primary features. In cases that do not have all of these features, a high index of suspicion guided by morphology and exclusion of other tumors in the histologic differential diagnosis can lead to the correct diagnosis.

As consequence of the multifunctional role of EWSR1 leading to a high frequency of transcription of the chromosomal region where the gene is located, EWSR1 is exposed to aberrations such as rearrangements. Consecutive binding to other genes leads to chimeric proteins inducing oncogenesis. The other TET family members are homologous. With the advent of widely used modern molecular techniques during the last decades, it has become obvious that EWSR1 is involved in the development of diverse benign and malignant tumors with mesenchymal, neuroectodermal, and epithelial/myoepithelial features. As oncogenic transformation mediated by EWSR1-fusion proteins leads to such diverse tumor types, there must be a selection on the multipotent stem cell level. In this review, we will focus on the wide variety of soft tissue and bone entities, including benign and malignant lesions, harboring EWSR1 rearrangement. Fusion gene analysis is the diagnostic gold standard in most of these tumors.

It shows distinctive chromosomal translocations resulting in fusion of FUS with the CREB3L2 gene in most cases and CREB3L1 in rare cases. Thus molecular studies are particularly helpful in the diagnosis of this bland-looking sarcoma. We report 2 cases of LGFMS serendipitously found to harbor a novel alternative EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusion, as confirmed by DNA sequencing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products and fluorescence in situ hybridization. One patient was a child who presented with a subcutaneous nodule on the lower leg, and the other was a middle-aged woman who had a mass lesion over the proximal thigh. Morphologically, one case showed a spindle cell tumor with hyalinization and giant rosettes, whereas the other showed classical histology of LGFMS with focal metaplastic bone formation. Immunostaining for MUC4 showed extensive positive staining. Our findings therefore expand the spectrum of gene fusions that characterize LGFMS and suggest that the EWSR1 gene may substitute for the function of FUS in gene fusions of sarcoma.;"[Lau, Patrick P.

Unlike the sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like features that characterize tumors with KMT2A::YAP1 fusions, VIM::KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas are more uniformly cellular and lack the extensively sclerotic background seen in the former. Most tumors behave aggressively with metastases on presentation. Here, we describe the clinicopathologic and molecular findings in two additional cases of VIM::KMT2A rearranged sarcomas that arose in the deep soft tissues of adult males. Both tumors were composed of hypercellular fascicles of uniform spindle cells with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and ovoid nuclei. The stroma had scant delicate collagen with occasional thin-walled ectatic blood vessels and perivascular hyalinization. Immunohistochemical studies showed an unspecific staining pattern with diffuse positivity for CD99 and BCL2 and variable staining for S100 protein. RNA-sequencing detected the presence of VIM::KMT2A gene fusion involving VIM exon 4 and KMT2A exon 2 in both cases. Sarcomas with VIM::KMT2A gene fusions seem to have sufficient morphologic features to warrant distinction from KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas with YAP1 partner. Without the benefit of molecular testing, these tumors pose a diagnostic challenge due to their lack of specific immunohistochemical profile and great morphologic overlap with other monomorphic spindle cell neoplasms.;"[Almohsen, Shahd S.; Dickson, Brendan C.; Demicco, Elizabeth G.] Univ Toronto, Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Almohsen, Shahd S.; Dickson, Brendan C.; Demicco, Elizabeth G.] Univ Toronto, Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Griffin, Anthony M.] Univ Toronto, Univ Musculoskeletal Oncol Unit, Dept Surg, Sinai Hlth Syst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Griffin, Anthony M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed Surg, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Demicco, Elizabeth G.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Room 6-120-04,600 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada";"University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute";Demicco, EG (corresponding author), Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Room 6-120-04,600 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.;elizabeth.demicco@sinaihealth.ca;"; Dickson, Brendan/J-2347-2016";"Almohsen, Shahd/0000-0002-0236-8904; Dickson, Brendan/0000-0003-2269-6216";;;;;29;2;2;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1045-2257;1098-2264;;GENE CHROMOSOME CANC;Gene Chromosomes Cancer;JUL;2023;62;7;;;;;405;411;;10.1002/gcc.23138;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gcc.23138;;MAR 2023;7;"Oncology; Genetics & Heredity";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Oncology; Genetics & Heredity";F5CB7;36959690;hybrid;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000962246800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor can arise at almost any site, although most frequently occurs within the extremities and trunk. Although most behave in a benign fashion, tumors can rarely show atypical or malignant features. It is now established that OFMTs represent translocation-associated tumors, with up to 85% associated with recurrent gene rearrangements, mostly involving the PHF1 gene (including in typical, atypical, and malignant neoplasms), with EP400-PHF1 in approximately 40% of tumors, and ZC3H7B-BCOR, MEAF6-PHF1, and EPC1-PHF1 fusions also described. Correct diagnosis is clinically important to ensure correct treatment and prognostication, both to avoid overdiagnosing OFMT as a malignant neoplasm such as osteosarcoma and also because of the propensity for aggressive behavior in a small number of OFMT. We review OFMT, with emphasis on the morphologic spectrum, recent molecular genetic findings, and the differential diagnosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

These gene fusions constitute pivotal driver mutations, and detailed studies of their cellular effects have provided important knowledge about pathogenetic mechanisms in STT. Furthermore, most fusions are strongly associated with a particular histotype, serving as ideal molecular diagnostic markers. In recent years, it has also become apparent that some chimeric proteins, directly or indirectly, constitute excellent treatment targets, making the detection of gene fusions in STT ever more important. Indeed, pharmacological treatment of STT displaying fusions that activate protein kinases, such as ALK and ROS1, or growth factors, such as PDGFB, is already in clinical use. However, the vast majority (52/78) of recurrent gene fusions create structurally altered and/or deregulated transcription factors, and a small but growing subset develops through rearranged chromatin regulators. The present review provides an overview of the spectrum of currently recognized gene fusions in STT, and, on the basis of the protein class involved, the mechanisms by which they exert their oncogenic effect are discussed.

Previous studies have found EWSR1 rearrangements in approximately half of all cases and PBX1, ZNF44 and POU5F1 have been identified as recurrent fusion partners. In bone, only a small number of myoepithelial tumours have been described. We investigated an intraosseous myoepithelioma of the sacrum in a 54-year-old man without EWSR1 rearrangement for the presence of other fusion genes. Methods and resultsG-banding analysis, SNP-array and fluorescence in situ hybridisation suggested rearrangement of the FUS and POU5F1 genes. RT-PCR confirmed a chimeric in-frame transcript fusing FUS exon 5 to POU5F1 exon 2. The clinical course after en bloc resection was without recurrence or metastasis over a period of 87months. ConclusionWe report a novel FUS-POU5F1 fusion gene in an intraosseous myoepithelioma of the sacrum. This case highlights that FUS can replace EWSR1 as the N-terminal transactivator in oncogenic fusion genes in myoepithelial tumours, similar to that which has previously been demonstrated in other tumour entities. Thus, in addition to EWSR1, also FUS needs to be considered as a potential fusion partner in the molecular work up of myoepithelial tumours.;"[Puls, Florian; Kindblom, Lars-Gunnar] Royal Orthopaed Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Musculoskeletal Pathol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Arbajian, Elsa; Magnusson, Linda; Mertens, Fredrik] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Genet, Lund, Sweden; [Arbajian, Elsa; Magnusson, Linda; Mertens, Fredrik] Lund Univ, Reg Labs, Skane Univ Hosp, Lund, Sweden; [Douis, Hassan] Royal Orthopaed Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Musculoskeletal Radiol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Kindblom, Lars-Gunnar] Univ Birmingham, Sch Canc Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England";"Royal Orthopaedic Hospital; Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Royal Orthopaedic Hospital; University of Birmingham";Puls, F (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Dept Musculoskeletal Pathol, Royal Orthopaed Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Robert Aitken Inst Clin Res, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.;florian.puls@nhs.net;Arbajian, Elsa/AAW-9123-2021;"Arbajian, Elsa/0000-0002-1484-0073; Puls, Florian/0000-0002-9841-4230; Mertens, Fredrik/0000-0002-6278-5232";Swedish Cancer Society;Swedish Cancer Society(Swedish Cancer Society);The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Cancer Society.;;27;22;24;0;0;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0309-0167;1365-2559;;HISTOPATHOLOGY;Histopathology;DEC;2014;65;6;;;;;917;922;;10.1111/his.12517;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/his.12517;;;6;"Cell Biology; Pathology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Cell Biology; Pathology";AU4IO;25066216;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000345574400019;View Full Record in Web of Science

These lesions often demonstrate overlapping clinical and radiologic characteristics and share histomorphologic and sometimes immunophenotypic similarities, but they typically have diverse prognostic outcomes, thus warranting different clinical management. Recent advances in molecular and cytogenetic techniques have identified a number of novel molecular alterations contributing to the diversity of these lesions. This state-of-the-art knowledge has enhanced our understanding of these diseases. Objective.-To provide an overview of the current concepts in the classification and diagnosis of small round cell tumors of soft tissue and bone, focusing on salient and recent molecular genetic advancements. Data Sources.-Data were obtained from pertinent peer-reviewed English-language literature and firsthand experience from the authors as practicing bone and soft tissue pathologists. Conclusions.-Immunohistochemistry plays a vital role in rendering a specific diagnosis or narrowing the differential diagnosis in small round cell tumors of soft tissue and bone.

Diagnosing these tumors is challenging based on the significant number of different tumor entities, the rareness of these tumors, and the considerable morphological heterogeneity which can be found within a single tumor entity. Considering that more than half of the described soft-tissue tumors and approximately 25% of the bone tumors harbor recurrent genetic alterations, the use of auxiliary molecular examinations should be strongly considered. Molecular analyses are important to confirm the diagnosis, to guide treatment, to provide information about prognosis, and to allow patient recruitment for basket trials based on the molecular signature of a tumor. In addition, novel molecular alterations detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) obtain further insights into the pathogenesis of these rare tumors and allow a more detailed genetic classification. Based on our single-center results of NGS using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 and the Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for mutational analyses as well as the Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma Kit (ArcherDX, Inc) to detect gene fusions in 26 genes since early 2016, we have experienced NGS as a very sensitive method to detect genetic alterations. In our experience, the use of the Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma Kit is superior to fluorescent in situ hybridization as an auxiliary tool in the routine workup of soft-tissue and bone tumors. (c) 2017 S.

Large case series or diagnostic updates have not been recently published despite identification of molecular alterations that could improve diagnostic accuracy. Our review of the literature found that over two-thirds of the more than 30 types of PFMTs harbor recurrent molecular alterations. We performed an institutional review of PFMTs to highlight limitations of a predominantly morphological classification, and evaluated the utility of a next-generation sequencing assay to aid diagnosis. Methods PFMTs identified over a period of 12 years were reviewed, categorized per the new WHO classification, and tested using the Oncomine Childhood Cancer Research Assay. Results Eighty-seven specimens from 58 patients were reviewed; 50 were chosen for molecular analysis, 16 (32%) lacking definitive classification. We identified alterations, some novel, in 33% of assayed cases. Expected alterations were identified for most known diagnoses and mutations were identified in 6 of 16 tumors (38%) that were initially unclassified. Conclusion We confirmed a significant subset of PFMTs remain difficult to classify using current criteria, and that a combined DNA/RNA assay can identify alterations in many of these cases, improving diagnostic certainty and suggesting a clinical utility for challenging cases.";"[Slack, Jonathan C.; Brundler, Marie-Anne; Nohr, Erik; Kurek, Kyle C.] Cumming Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Brundler, Marie-Anne] Cumming Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Calgary, AB, Canada; [McIntyre, John B.] Univ Calgary, Tom Baker Canc Ctr, Dept Oncol, Precis Oncol Hub Lab, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Kurek, Kyle C.] Cumming Sch Med, Dept Genet, Calgary, AB, Canada";"University of Calgary; Tom Baker Cancer Clinic";Kurek, KC (corresponding author), Alberta Childrens Prov Gen Hosp, 28 Oki Dr NW, Calgary, AB T3B 6A8, Canada.;Kyle.Kurek@ucalgary.ca;McIntyre, JB/ABE-9340-2021;;"Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute; University of Calgary Anatomical Pathology Residency Program";"Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute; University of Calgary Anatomical Pathology Residency Program";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute (KCK) and the University of Calgary Anatomical Pathology Residency Program (JCS).;;100;3;3;0;4;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1093-5266;1615-5742;;PEDIATR DEVEL PATHOL;Pediatr.

This is a markedly heterogeneous group, and the diagnosis of USTS remains one of exclusion. USTS can be divided into four morphologic subgroups: pleomorphic, spindle cell, round cell and epithelioid undifferentiated sarcomas, with this combined group accounting for up to 20% of all soft tissue sarcomas. As molecular advances enable the stratification of emerging genetic subsets within USTS, particularly within undifferentiated round cell sarcomas, other groups, particularly the category of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS), still remain difficult to substratify and represent heterogeneous collections of neoplasms often representing the common morphologic endpoints of a variety of malignant tumors of various (mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal) lineages. However, recent molecular developments have also enabled the identification and correct classification of many tumors from various lines of differentiation that would previously have been bracketed under 'UPS'. This includes pleomorphic neoplasms and dedifferentiated neoplasms (the latter typically manifesting with an undifferentiated pleomorphic morphology) of mesenchymal (e.g. solitary fibrous tumor and gastrointestinal stromal tumor) and non-mesenchymal (e.g. melanoma and carcinoma) origin. The precise categorization of 'pleomorphic' or 'undifferentiated' neoplasms is critical for prognostication, as, for example, dedifferentiated liposarcoma typically behaves less aggressively than other pleomorphic sarcomas, and for management, including the potential for targeted therapies based on underlying recurrent molecular features. In this review we focus on undifferentiated and dedifferentiated pleomorphic and spindle cell neoplasms, summarizing their key genetic, morphologic and immunophenotypic features in the routine diagnostic setting, and the use of immunohistochemistry in their principal differential diagnosis, and highlight new developments and entities in the group of undifferentiated and dedifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas.;"[Thway, Khin] Royal Marsden Hosp, Sarcoma Unit, London SW3 6JJ, England; [Thway, Khin; Fisher, Cyril] Inst Canc Res, Div Mol Pathol, 237 Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England; [Fisher, Cyril] Univ Hosp Birmingham NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Pathol, Birmingham B15 2GW, W Midlands, England";"Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust; University of London; Institute of Cancer Research - UK; Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust; University of Birmingham";"Thway, K (corresponding author), Royal Marsden Hosp, Sarcoma Unit, London SW3 6JJ, England.;Thway, K (corresponding author), Inst Canc Res, Div Mol Pathol, 237 Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England.";khin.thway@rmh.nhs.uk;;;;;;;197;1;3;0;5;W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC;PHILADELPHIA;1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA;0740-2570;1930-1111;;SEMIN DIAGN PATHOL;Semin.

To report the exceptional occurrence of ossifying fibromyxoid tumour (OFMT) as a primary bone lesion. OFMT is a rare soft tissue tumour of uncertain differentiation and variable malignant potential, that occurs in adults with a slight male predominance. It is typically located in the subcutis or in the skeletal muscles of the extremities, followed by trunk or head and neck. Methods. Two cases of OFMT proven to arise from bone are presented. The first is a 65-year old female with a history of rib osteosarcoma, presenting with an inferior lobe left lung mass. The second is a man with a lytic lesion of the 5th cervical vertebra that recurred shortly after resection. Following H&E and immunohistochemical examination, tumour samples were analysed by NGS and by break-apart FISH to detect rearrangement of the PHF1 and TFE3 genes. Results. PHF1 gene-rearrangement was identified by FISH on both the primary and the metastatic lesion of first patient. NGS identified a PHF1(intron1) and EPC1 (exon 10) fusion transcript later confirmed by positive PHF1 rearrangement on FISH in the second case. Conclusions. The demonstration of PHF1 gene rearrangements represents a fundamental ancillary diagnostic test when presented with challenging examples of OFMT.;"[Sbaraglia, Marta; Dei Tos, Angelo P.] Azienda Osped Univ Padova, Dept Pathol, Via Gabelli 61, I-35121 Padua, PD, Italy; [Bellan, Elena; Dei Tos, Angelo P.] Univ Padua, Sch Med, Dept Med, Padua, Italy; [Gambarotti, Marco; Righi, Alberto] Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Unit Pathol, Bologna, Italy; [Zanatta, Lucia; Toffolatti, Luisa] Azienda ULSS 2 Marca Trevigiana, Dept Pathol, Treviso, Italy";"University of Padua; Azienda Ospedaliera - Universita di Padova; University of Padua; IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli; ULSS 2 Marca TV; Ospedale Ca' Foncello Treviso";Sbaraglia, M (corresponding author), Azienda Osped Univ Padova, Dept Pathol, Via Gabelli 61, I-35121 Padua, PD, Italy.;marta.sbaraglia@aopd.veneto.it;"Sbaraglia, Marta/AAC-4996-2022; Sbaraglia, Marta/GRF-5729-2022; Gambarotti, Marco/C-6878-2019";"Gambarotti, Marco/0000-0002-8080-4484; DEI TOS, ANGELO/0000-0002-1228-8940";;;;;28;4;4;0;0;PACINI EDITORE;PISA;VIA DELLA GHERARDESCA-ZONA INDUSTRIALE OSPEDALETTO, 56121 PISA, ITALY;0031-2983;1591-951X;;PATHOLOGICA;Pathologica;DEC;2020;112;4;;;;;184;190;;10.32074/1591-951X-207;http://dx.doi.org/10.32074/1591-951X-207;;;7;Pathology;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Pathology;PP3ED;33179613;gold, Green Published;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000605748500004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Owing to variable morphology and a lack of discriminatory markers, LGFMS can be difficult to distinguish from benign mesenchymal tumors and other low-grade sarcomas. Gene expression profiling has identified differential upregulation of the mucin 4 (MUC4) gene in LGFMS compared with histologically similar tumors. MUC4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions in cell growth signaling pathways; aberrant MUC4 expression has been reported in various carcinomas. We investigated MUC4 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in LGFMS and in other soft tissue tumors to determine the potential diagnostic use of this novel marker. Whole-tissue sections of 309 tumors were evaluated: 49 LGFMSs (all with FUS gene rearrangement confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization), 40 soft tissue perineuriomas, 40 myxofibrosarcomas, 20 cellular myxomas, 20 solitary fibrous tumors, 20 low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 20 cases of desmoid fibromatosis, 20 neurofibromas, 20 schwannomas, 20 monophasic synovial sarcomas, 20 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 10 myxoid liposarcomas, and 10 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas. The LGFMS cases included 7 with marked hypercellularity, 4 with prominent hemangiopericytoma-like vessels, 3 with giant collagen rosettes, 3 with epithelioid morphology, 2 with focal nuclear pleomorphism, and 2 with areas of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. All 49 LGFMS cases (100%) showed cytoplasmic staining for MUC4, which was usually diffuse and intense. All the other tumor types were negative for MUC4, apart from 6 (30%) monophasic synovial sarcomas. In conclusion, MUC4 is a highly sensitive and quite specific immunohistochemical marker for LGFMS, and can be helpful to distinguish this tumor type from histologic mimics.";"[Doyle, Leona A.; Dal Cin, Paola; Fletcher, Christopher D.

Results for smooth muscle actins, beta-catenin, desmin, S100 protein, Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and STAT6 immunohistochemistry, as well as FUS rearrangement status, were recorded when available. Sites included neck (8), supraclavicular region (4) and orbit (1), parapharyngeal space (1) and lower lip (1). The age of the patients ranged from 3 to 97 years (median, 26 years). Tumors displayed classical morphologic features of LGFMS, as described. All cases (15/15) were positive for MUC4, and all cases tested (4/4) harbored FUS rearrangement. Variable positivity for EMA was identified in one case. Follow-up was available in 11 patients, ranging from 2 to 240 months (mean 71.4 months; median, 44 months). Three tumors recurred locally; none metastasized. In conclusion, although distinctly uncommon, LGFMS may arise in the head and neck region and should be distinguished from other more common spindle cell tumors in these locations. The morphologic, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic features of head/neck LGFMS are identical to those occurring elsewhere.

An SFT may develop almost anywhere throughout the body, including the head and neck region, and is characterized by a broad spectrum of malignancy. Here we present a case involving a 57-year-old male with a dumbbell-shaped SFT in the cervical spine that mimicked schwannoma. Repeated fine-needle aspiration cytology failed to establish a definitive diagnosis. Given that the tumor size increased significantly over a 10-month period, open biopsy was then performed. Though the biopsy result was inconclusive, a nonepithelial tumor, including sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma or ossifying fibromyxoid tumor, was suspected. The tumor was then completely removed together with adjacent parts of C2 and C3 vertebrae and left vertebral artery via combined anterior and posterior approaches. Histologically, the tumor consisted of round cells with prominent stromal hyalinization and was immunohistochemically positive for STAT6, CD34, and cytokeratin. Finally, Todai OncoPanel, a next-generation sequencing-based molecular profiling system using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, demonstrated fusion transcript in which NAB2 exon 6 was fused to STAT6 exon 16 supporting the diagnosis of SFT, while whole-exome sequencing analysis detected no somatic mutations which were known to be oncogenic.

The detection and characterization of such tumorigenic fusions is of great importance both research-wise, diagnostically because they may be specific for distinct tumor entities, and because they may serve as therapeutic targets for antioncogenic drugs that interact directly with the molecular changes responsible for neoplastic transformation. At present, more than 10,000 fusion transcripts have been reported in different types of neoplasia, with one tenth of them being identified in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of different locations. No recurrent fusion gene has to date been identified in SCC of the vulva. We performed high-throughput paired-end RNA-sequencing of 12 vulvar SCC and found two recurrent fusions with the STIP1-CREB3L1 and ZDHHC5-GPR137 being present in two tumors each.

This cohort of eight women with mean and median ages of 45 and 46 years, respectively (range 19-65 years), had unencapsulated, well-circumscribed tumors composed of tightly packed anastomosing follicle-like cysts filled with eosinophilic colloid-like material and lined by cuboidal cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, oval to elongated nuclei with perpendicular arrangement toward the lumens, and prominent nuclear overlapping. The stroma between these was minimal with the exception of two tumors. Calcifications and necrosis were absent. Immunohistochemically, the tumors were positive for KRT19 (7/7), PAX8 (5/5), cyclin D1 (6/6), KRT7 (5/7), and AMACR (1/5; focal, weak), and were negative for WT1, TTF1 (transcription termination factor-1), and thyroglobulin. In three of three tumors tested molecularly, EWSR1-PATZ1 fusion was identified by RNA sequencing and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Over a follow-up period of 1-7 years, no evidence of recurrence or metastasis has been detected. The EWSR1-PATZ1 fusion has been recognized as a recurrent alteration in a subset of round to spindle cell sarcomas with EWSR1-non-ETS fusions (EWSR1-PATZ1 sarcoma) and in several central nervous system tumors. The finding of an EWSR1-PATZ1 fusion in all three of the thyroid-like follicular renal cell carcinomas for which sufficient tissue was available for genomic profiling provides the first distinct molecular abnormality in thyroid-like follicular renal cell carcinomas, supporting its designation as a distinct diagnostic entity.";"[Al-Obaidy, Khaleel, I; Cheng, Liang; Alruwaii, Fatimah, I; Idrees, Muhammad T.; Nassiri, Mehdi; Eble, John N.; Grignon, David J.] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Bridge, Julia A.] ProPath, Div Mol Pathol, Dallas, TX USA; [Bridge, Julia A.] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Microbiol, Omaha, NE USA; [Sumegi, Janos] Translat Genom Res Inst, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Reuter, Victor E.; Benayed, Ryma; Hameed, Meera] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Williamson, Sean R.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Hes, Ondrej] Charles Univ Hosp Pilsen, Dept Pathol, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Segal, Jeremy P.; Wanjari, Pankhuri] Univ Chicago, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA";"Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Translational Genomics Research Institute; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Charles University Prague; University of Chicago; University of Chicago Medical Center";Eble, JN (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA.;jeble@iupui.edu;"IDREES, MUHAMMAD/JLM-2401-2023; , Mehdi/ABC-8261-2020; Al-Obaidy, Khaleel/Q-4731-2019";", Mehdi/0000-0001-9398-1693; Cheng, Liang/0000-0001-6049-5293; Hameed, Meera/0000-0002-2766-243X; Al-Obaidy, Khaleel/0000-0001-9890-8751; Williamson, Sean/0000-0002-3898-1460";;;;;54;22;25;0;6;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;0893-3952;1530-0285;;MODERN PATHOL;Mod.

However, LGFMS has been described in other locations including the head and neck, retroperitoneum, and mesentery. Translocations involving the FUS gene located at 16p are considered to be highly specific for the diagnosis of this tumor when present in conjunction with the appropriate morphologic appearance. We report 4 cases of LGFMS arising in the small bowel. The patients' ages (3 female, 1 male) ranged from 52 to 71 years (median, 61 y). None of the patients had a history of soft tissue sarcoma. An intramural tumor was presented in all cases, ranging from 4.5 to 14.5 cm in greatest diameter (mean, 10 cm). Microscopically, the tumors consisted of an admixture of hypocellular, heavily collagenized zones and more cellular myxoid nodules, containing a greater number of neoplastic cells arranged around characteristic curvilinear vessels. By immunohistochemistry, all tumors were positive for vimentin and negative for smooth muscle actin, CD117, CD34, and S100 protein. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for rearrangement of the FUS locus at 16p11 was positive in 3 informative cases. Follow-up information was available in 3 cases; 2 patients are alive without disease and another patient died of disease. We conclude that LGFMS should be included in the differential diagnosis of fibrous or myxoid spindle cell tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. On the basis of limited follow-up, the natural history of enteric LGFMS seems to be similar to that of LGFMS in other locations, with potential for late metastases.";"[Laurini, Javier A.; Zhang, Lizhi; Folpe, Andrew L.] Mayo Clin, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Goldblum, John R.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Anat Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Montgomery, Elizabeth] Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA";"Mayo Clinic; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine";Folpe, AL (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.;Folpe.Andrew@Mayo.edu;zhang, zhaohan/B-4460-2014;;;;;;33;23;24;0;3;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0147-5185;1532-0979;;AM J SURG PATHOL;Am.

We assessed the outcomes of 56 patients with soft tissue, and 21 with bone sarcomas, enrolled in Phase 1 trials. Experimental Design: In this Sarcoma-Matched Biomarker Analysis (SAMBA-102 study), we reviewed records from patients on Phase 1 trials at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 2013 and June 2021. Results: Among 587 sarcomas, 106 (18.1%) were classified as URS. Fifty (47%) were male, and the median age was 44.3 years (range, 19-82). The most common subtypes were alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), chordoma, dedifferentiated chondro-sarcoma, and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. Compared with common sarcomas, median OS was similar 16.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 13.6-17.5] versus 16.1 (95% CI, 8.2-24.0) in URS (P = 0.359). Objective response to treatment was higher in URS 13.2% (n = 14/106) compared with common sarcomas 6.9% (n = 33/481; P = 0.029). Median OS for those treated on matched trials was 27.3 months (95% CI, 1.9-52.7) compared with 13.4 months (95% CI, 6.3-20.6) for those not treated on matched trials (P = 0.291). Eight of 33 (24%) molecularly matched treatments resulted in an objective response, whereas 6 of 73 unmatched treatments (8.2%) resulted in an objective response (P = 0.024). Clinical benefit rate was 36.4% (12/33) in matched trials versus 26.0% (19/73) in unmatched trials (P = 0.279).

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is a rare malignant fibroblastic tumor with decep-tively bland spindle cell morphology. Involvement of the breast is exceedingly rare. We examined the clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of three cases of breast/axillary LGFMS. In addition, we interrogated the immunohistochemical expression of MUC4, a commonly used marker of LGFMS, in other breast spindle cell lesions. LGFMS presented in women at 23, 33, and 59 years of age. Tumor size ranged from 0.9 to 4.7 cm. Microscopically, they were circumscribed nodular masses composed of bland spindle cells with fibromyxoid stroma. Immunohistochemically, tumors were diffusely positive for MUC4 and negative for keratin, CD34, S100 protein, and nuclear beta-catenin. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization demonstrated FUS (n = 2) or EWSR1 (n = 1) rearrangements. Next-generation sequencing identified FUS::CREB3L2 and EWSR1::CREB3L1 fusions. MUC4 immunohistochemistry performed on 162 additional breast lesions demonstrated only weak and limited expression in a subset of cases of fibromatosis (10/20, <30% staining), scar (5/9, <10%), metaplastic carcinoma (4/23, <5%), and phyllodes tumor (3/74, <10%). MUC4 was entirely negative in cases of pseudoangioma-tous stromal hyperplasia (n = 9), myofibroblastoma (n = 6), periductal stromal tumor (n = 3), and cellular/juvenile fibroadenoma (n = 21). LGFMS can rarely occur in the breast and should be consid-ered in the differential diagnosis of breast spindle cell lesions. Strong and diffuse MUC4 expression is highly specific in this histologic context. Detection of an FUS or EWSR1 rearrangement can confirm the diagnosis.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

More than 90% of these neoplasms are classified as osteosarcomas, Ewing sarcomas or chondrosarcomas, and their clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment principles are well-established. The entities described in this article, are ultra-rare varieties of bone sarcomas, and there clinical and histological characteristics are not well known. Therefore, they are very difficult to be diagnosed and there is a lot of uncertainty on their treatment. Because of their rarity, it is also extremely difficult to perform clinical research on these cancers. This article creates more awareness of these very rare bone tumors. It explains how to recognize and diagnose each entity and it summarizes the medical scientific literature that is available on these cancers. Increasing awareness and clinical research for these cancers are key elements to improve the prognosis for patients with these diseases in the long term. Rare primary malignant bone sarcomas (RPMBS), other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, chordoma, and Ewing sarcoma, account for about 5-10% of primary bone tumors and represent a major diagnostic challenge. These tumors include spindle cell and round cell sarcoma entities, hemangiopericytoma-like and vascular tumors. Additionally, several histotypes, traditionally described in the soft tissues, such as myxofibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor of bone, have been reported in patients with primary bone tumors. While wide surgical resection is the mainstay of local treatment, systemic therapy of these rare entities is controversial. Patients with undifferentiated spindle cell or pleomorphic high-grade tumors of bone, are usually treated with osteosarcoma-like chemotherapy, while patients with round cell and undifferentiated round cell tumors (URCTs), may respond to sarcoma treatment regimens for Ewing sarcoma patients. Studies on analogies and differences among these ultra-rare tumors have seldom been reported. This review describes relevance, clinical aspects, diagnostic procedures, staging, treatment recommendations, and current research in this composite tumor group.;"[Palmerini, Emanuela] IRCCS Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Chemotherapy Unit, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Righi, Alberto] IRCCS Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Surg Pathol, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Staals, Eric L.] IRCCS Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Orthopaed Surg, I-40136 Bologna, Italy";;Palmerini, E (corresponding author), IRCCS Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Chemotherapy Unit, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.;"emanuela.palmerini3@unibo.it; alberto.righi@ior.it; eric.staals@ior.it";Palmerini, Emanuela/AAB-5920-2019;Palmerini, Emanuela/0000-0003-3406-6705;European Commission [SEP-210512885];European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre);We would like to thank Sarcoma European & LatinAmerican Network (SELNET), a consortium granted by European Commission (number: SEP-210512885), for supporting the idea of this special issu.

Although apparently being a valuable diagnostic marker for differentiating between small cell osteosarcoma (SCO) and other small round cell tumors of bone, for instance Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), it has not been tested in a large series of ESFT and chondrosarcomas so far. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of SATB2 in 42 osteosarcomas, 31 chondrosarcomas, and 371 genetically confirmed ESFT. SATB2 positivity was detected in 90.4% of osteosarcomas, 87.5% of SCO, 91.3% of osteoblastic osteosarcomas, and in all chondroblastic and parosteal osteosarcomas. The osteoblastic and SCO subtypes expressed SATB2 more intensely than other histological types. SATB2 was expressed in 46.6% of chondrosarcomas, and in 1.3% of ESFT. Sensitivity and specificity of SATB2 immunoexpression were 90.4% and 95.3%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values in osteosarcoma diagnosis were 66.6% and 98.9%, respectively. In chondrosarcoma, SATB2 immunoexpression was more frequent and intense in high-grade chondrosarcoma (Grade III) and uncommon in chondrosarcoma grade I. SATB2 positivity was detected in 55.6% of chondrosarcomas grade II. SATB2 apparently cannot distinguish between chondroblastic osteosarcoma and high-grade chondrosarcoma. Nevertheless, SATB2 is frequently expressed in osteogenic tumors, but is rarely positive in ESFT, and with the support of CD99 expression and specific molecular studies, it is very useful for distinguishing between these two lesions. Although SATB2 immunoexpression helps to distinguish osteosarcoma from their mimickers, the identification of malignant osteoid matrix formation and the integration of clinical and radiological data remain the corner stone of osteosarcoma diagnosis and as yet no antibody has equalled the diagnostic value of this important morphologic hallmark.

Its occurrence in the lower female genital tract is rare, and thus it may not be always considered in the differential diagnosis. We describe the salient features of 7 vulvovaginal LGFMS identified in the authors' consultation files. Clinical information was obtained from referring pathologists. Archival slides were reviewed, and immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed in cases with available material. Median age was 40 years (range, 34 to 58 y). Primary sites included vulva (n=6) and vagina (n=1). Tumors were 1.2 to 8.7 cm (median, 5.0 cm) in size and grossly circumscribed with firm to focally gelatinous cut surfaces. Microscopically, 5/7 had infiltrative edges. All tumors showed fibrous and myxoid areas, with lobulated myxoid foci in 5/7, comprising storiform, patternless, or (less often) fascicular arrangement of spindled to stellate cells with bland, slender to ovoid nuclei. In all cases, mitoses were <1/2.4 mm(2), and necrosis was absent. Capillary arcades were seen in 3/7. Margins were positive in 3/6. Immunohistochemistry showed positive epithelial membrane antigen in 4/6 and MUC4 in 5/6. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected FUS rearrangement in 5/7. Both tumors without FUS rearrangement were also negative for EWSR1 rearrangement. All 5 patients with available follow-up were alive and disease-free 10 to 150 months (median, 57 mo) after diagnosis. However, a review of vulvovaginal/pelvic LGFMS previously reported shows recurrences as late as 45 years after initial diagnosis. Pathologists need to be aware that LGFMS can arise in the vulvovaginal region. Tumor lobulation, capillary arcades, and positive MUC4 are helpful features distinguishing LGFMS from other bland myxoid spindle cell neoplasms in the lower female genital tract. Molecular testing can be useful in challenging cases. Complete excision is feasible for most vulvovaginal LGFMS. Long-term surveillance is required as local and/or distant spread can occur decades after diagnosis.;"[Costigan, Danielle; Nucci, Marisa R.; Parra-Herran, Carlos; Chapel, David B.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Womens & Perinatal Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fletcher, Christopher D.

Based on this novel classification system, we reviewed the current knowledge on all tumor entities with spinal manifestations, their biologic behavior, and most importantly the appropriate treatment options as well as surgical approaches. Methods: All tumor entities were extracted from the WHO Soft-Tissue and Bone Tumor Classification (5th Edition). PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for the published cases of spinal tumor manifestations for each entity, and the following characteristics were extracted: Growth pattern, ability to metastasize, peak age, incidence, treatment, type of surgical resection indicated, recurrence rate, risk factors, 5-year survival rate, key molecular or genetic alterations, and possible associated tumor syndromes. Surgical treatment strategies as well as nonsurgical treatment recommendations are presented based on the biologic behavior of each lesion. Results: Out of 163 primary tumor entities of bone and soft tissue, 92 lesions have been reported along the spinal axis. Of these 92 entities, 54 have the potential to metastasize. The peak age ranges from conatal lesions to 72 years. For each tumor entity, we present recommended surgical treatment strategies based on the ability to locally destruct tissue, to grow, recur after resection, undergo malignant transformation as well as survival rates. In addition, potential systemic treatment recommendations for each tumor entity are outlined. Conclusion: Based on the 5th Edition of the WHO bone and soft tumor classification, we identified 92 out of 163 tumor entities, which potentially can have spinal manifestations. Exact preoperative tissue diagnosis and interdisciplinary case discussions are crucial. Surgical resection is indicated in a significant subset of patients and has to be tailored to the specific biologic behavior of the targeted tumor entity based on the considerations outlined in detail in this article.;"[Arvind, Varun] Icahn Sch Med, Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, New York, NY USA; [Ghaly, Maged] North Shore Univ Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Manhasset, NY USA; [Nasim, Mansoor] North Shore Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, Manhasset, NY USA; [Sciubba, Daniel; Spiessberger, Alexander] North Shore Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, 300 Community Dr, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [Nevzati, Edin] Cantonal Hosp Lucerne, Dept Neurosurg, Luzern, Switzerland; [Farshad, Mazda] Balgrist Univ Hosp, Dept Orthoped, Zurich, Switzerland; [Guggenberger, Roman] Univ Hosp Zurich, Dept Radiol, Zurich, Switzerland";"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Northwell Health; North Shore University Hospital; Northwell Health; North Shore University Hospital; Northwell Health; North Shore University Hospital; Lucerne Cantonal Hospital; University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital";Spiessberger, A (corresponding author), North Shore Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, 300 Community Dr, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA.;alexander.s.spiessberger@gmail.com;Nevzati, Edin/HSG-7069-2023;Guggenberger, Roman/0000-0002-5903-2248;;;;;88;3;4;0;2;WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS;MUMBAI;WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, Maharashtra, INDIA;0974-8237;0976-9285;;J CRANIOVERTEBRAL JU;J.

Given the responsiveness to selective NTRK inhibitors, it remains critical to identify those ultra-rare cases occurring in the viscera of adults. In five females and two males aged 18-53 years, we characterized visceral mesenchymal tumors harboring TPM3-NTRK1 [uterine cervix (N = 2), pleura, prostate], LMNA-NTRK1 (lung), SQSTM1-NTRK3 (heart), and NTRK3 rearrangement with unknown fusion partner (colon/mesocolon) with RNA sequencing, FISH, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. The tumors exhibited spindled to ovoid/epithelioid or pleomorphic cells, often arranged in fascicles, and were low-to-intermediate-grade and high-grade in three and four cases, respectively. Keloid-like stromal collagen and perivascular hyalinization was noted in five. Adenosarcoma-like appearances were observed in two, manifesting frond-like protrusions in one cervical tumor and phyllodes-like architecture in the prostatic tumor. Abrupt high-grade transformation into pleomorphic liposarcoma was found in another cervical tumor, while the pleural tumor contained intermixed rhabdomyoblasts. Pan-TRK immunostaining was positive in all cases. All cases expressed CD34, while five were S100-positive. CDKN2A homozygous deletion with concomitant p16 loss occurred in 4/7. Whole-exome sequencing identified TP53 mutation (c.672+2T>C, involving a splice site, with concomitant protein loss) in a cervical sarcoma, limited to its heterologous liposarcomatous component. At least moderate pan-TRK immunoreactivity was present in varying proportions of potential pathologic mimics, with BCOR-positive sarcoma (56%, 5/9), undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (50%, 3/6), and spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (33%, 2/6) being among the most frequent. This underscored the unsatisfactory specificity of pan-TRK immunohistochemistry and warranted molecular confirmation in the diagnosis of adult NTRK-rearranged visceral mesenchymal neoplasms. The current report highlights the ever-expanding clinicopathologic and genetic spectrum of this entity by describing the unprecedented cardiac and pleural locations and heterologous differentiation, as well as the second NTRK-rearranged prostatic stromal sarcoma, while substantiating CDKN2A deletion as a frequent occurrence.;"[Tsai, Jen-Wei] I Shou Univ, E Da Hosp, Dept Pathol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lee, Jen-Chieh] Natl Taiwan Univ, Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Dept & Grad Inst Pathol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Tsung-Han] Taipei Med Univ, Off Human Res, Joint Biobank, Taipei, Taiwan; [Huang, Shih-Chiang] Chang Gung Univ, Linkou Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Anat Pathol, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Huang, Shih-Chiang] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Grad Inst Clin Med Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Lee, Pei-Hang; Liu, Ting-Ting; Yu, Shih-Chen; Wang, Jui-Chu; Huang, Hsuan-Ying] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Anat Pathol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lee, Pei-Hang; Liu, Ting-Ting; Chang, Ching-Di; Su, Yu-Li; Yu, Shih-Chen; Wang, Jui-Chu; Huang, Hsuan-Ying] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Kao, Yu-Chien] Taipei Med Univ, Shuang Ho Hosp, Dept Pathol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Kao, Yu-Chien] Taipei Med Univ, Coll Med, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Ching-Di] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Radiol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Weng, Te-Fu] Chung Shan Med Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Li, Chien-Feng] Chi Mei Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Tainan, Taiwan; [Lin, Jung-Chia] Kaohsiung Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Liang, Cher-Wei] Fu Jen Catholic Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Liang, Cher-Wei] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Coll Med, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Su, Yu-Li] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Med Oncol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chang, Ian Yi-Feng] Chang Gung Univ, Linkou Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Chang, Ian Yi-Feng] Chang Gung Univ, Mol Med Res Ctr, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Wang, Yu-Ting] Chung Shan Med Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Nien-Yi] China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, Taichung, Taiwan";"I Shou University; E-Da Hospital; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University; Chang Gung University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University; Taipei Medical University; Shuang Ho Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chung Shan Medical University; Chung Shan Medical University Hospital; Chi Mei Hospital; Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital; Fu Jen Catholic University; Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital; Fu Jen Catholic University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University; Chung Shan Medical University; Chung Shan Medical University Hospital; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan";"Huang, HY (corresponding author), Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Anat Pathol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;Huang, HY (corresponding author), Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.";a120600310@yahoo.com;Huang, Shih-Chiang/G-3197-2013;"Huang, Shih-Chiang/0000-0002-5092-4434; Chang, Ian/0000-0001-5840-2051";"Bayer pharmaceutical Co.

Usually, cancer cells hijack processes used by healthy cells during organism development. The Hippo pathway is a developmental signaling system with a critical role in tissue and organ size regulation, which is frequently deregulated in cancer. Indeed, the contribution of Hippo dysfunction to cancer development has been extensively reported in carcinomas, but it is increasingly recognized in sarcomas. Sarcomas are rare cancers that develop in the bones and soft tissues, encompassing a large variety of different subtypes. Here we review the relevance of the Hippo pathway in specific sarcoma subtypes, with a focus on both the genetic alterations in Hippo pathway genes as well as other molecular mechanisms involved in its deregulation. The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved modulator of developmental biology with a key role in tissue and organ size regulation under homeostatic conditions. Like other signaling pathways with a significant role in embryonic development, the deregulation of Hippo signaling contributes to oncogenesis. Central to the Hippo pathway is a conserved cascade of adaptor proteins and inhibitory kinases that converge and regulate the activity of the oncoproteins YAP and TAZ, the final transducers of the pathway. Elevated levels and aberrant activation of YAP and TAZ have been described in many cancers. Though most of the studies describe their pervasive activation in epithelial neoplasms, there is increasing evidence pointing out its relevance in mesenchymal malignancies as well. Interestingly, somatic or germline mutations in genes of the Hippo pathway are scarce compared to other signaling pathways that are frequently disrupted in cancer. However, in the case of sarcomas, several examples of genetic alteration of Hippo members, including gene fusions, have been described during the last few years. Here, we review the current knowledge of Hippo pathway implication in sarcoma, describing mechanistic hints recently reported in specific histological entities and how these alterations represent an opportunity for targeted therapy in this heterogeneous group of neoplasm.;"[Salguero-Aranda, Carmen; Olmedo-Pelayo, Joaquin; de alava, Enrique; Amaral, Ana Teresa; Diaz-Martin, Juan] Univ Seville, Virgen Rocio Univ Hosp, CSIC, Inst Biomed Sevilla IBiS, Seville 41013, Spain; [Salguero-Aranda, Carmen; Olmedo-Pelayo, Joaquin; de alava, Enrique; Amaral, Ana Teresa; Diaz-Martin, Juan] Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Canc, CIBERONC, ISCIII,CB16 12 0361, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Salguero-Aranda, Carmen; Olmedo-Pelayo, Joaquin; de alava, Enrique; Amaral, Ana Teresa; Diaz-Martin, Juan] Univ Seville, Sch Med, Dept Normal & Pathol Cytol & Histol, Seville 41009, Spain";"Virgen del Rocio University Hospital; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Sevilla; CSIC-JA-USE - Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS); Instituto de Salud Carlos III; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERONC; University of Sevilla";"de Alava, E; Diaz-Martin, J (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Virgen Rocio Univ Hosp, CSIC, Inst Biomed Sevilla IBiS, Seville 41013, Spain.;de Alava, E; Diaz-Martin, J (corresponding author), Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Canc, CIBERONC, ISCIII,CB16 12 0361, Madrid 28029, Spain.;de Alava, E; Diaz-Martin, J (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Sch Med, Dept Normal & Pathol Cytol & Histol, Seville 41009, Spain.";"enrique.alava.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es; jdiaz-ibis@us.es";"Diaz-Martin, Juan/F-4765-2015; de Alava, Enrique/GOH-0368-2022";"Diaz-Martin, Juan/0000-0002-3985-6434; de Alava, Enrique/0000-0001-8400-046X; Salguero Aranda, Carmen/0000-0001-6010-8302; Olmedo Pelayo, Joaquin/0000-0003-2768-971X; Amaral, Ana/0000-0001-7887-4814";"ISCIIIFEDER [PI20/00003]; Consejeria de Salud y Familias, Junta de Andalucia [PE-0186-2018, PI-0061-2020]; GEIS-Fundacion Mari Paz Jimenez Casado (Beca Trienal a la Investigacion en Sarcomas); Fundacion CRIS Contra el Cancer; Asociacion Pablo Ugarte; Fundacion Maria Garcia Estrada; CIBERONC; European Social Fund; Junta de Andalucia [DOC_01473]; Universidad de Sevilla; Juan de la Cierva Incorporacion fellowship [IJC-2018-036767-I]; CIBERONC [CB16/12/00361]";"ISCIIIFEDER(Spanish Government); Consejeria de Salud y Familias, Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); GEIS-Fundacion Mari Paz Jimenez Casado (Beca Trienal a la Investigacion en Sarcomas); Fundacion CRIS Contra el Cancer; Asociacion Pablo Ugarte; Fundacion Maria Garcia Estrada; CIBERONC; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Universidad de Sevilla; Juan de la Cierva Incorporacion fellowship; CIBERONC";"E.d.A.'s laboratory is supported by ISCIIIFEDER (PI20/00003) to E.d.A., Consejeria de Salud y Familias, Junta de Andalucia (PE-0186-2018) to E.d.A. and (PI-0061-2020) to C.S.-A. and E.d.A., GEIS (Beca Jose Maria Buesa) to A.T.A., GEIS-Fundacion Mari Paz Jimenez Casado (Beca Trienal a la Investigacion en Sarcomas) to J.D.-M., Fundacion CRIS Contra el Cancer, Asociacion Pablo Ugarte, Fundacion Maria Garcia Estrada and CIBERONC.

Many sarcomas are known to have such fusions, and the demonstration of the fusion transcripts in tumor tissue is of great value in specific diagnosis of synovial sarcoma (SYT-SSX), Ewing sarcoma (EWS-Fli1), clear cell sarcoma (EWS-ATF1 ), myxoid liposarcoma (FUS-CHOP), and other sarcomas. These translocations are believed to be disease-specific and pathogenetic forces, despite occasional observations to the contrary. Demonstration of SYT-SSX and EWS-ATF1 fusion assists in the diagnosis of synovial and clear cell sarcomas in unusual locations, such as the gastrointestinal tract, where these tumors occur with low frequency Demonstration of sarcoma translocations and their fusion by different assays is well established; use of in situ hybridization is limited by availability of specific probes. In two exceptional instances, the same translocation and gene fusion occurs in two unrelated diseases: ETV6-NTRK fusion in infantile fibrosarcoma and secretory carcinoma of the breast, and ALK-TPM3 fusion in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and large cell anaplastic lymphoma. Thus, the target cell of the genetic change is an important factor to define the resulting disease. Activating mutations in two related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) is central to the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and countering the mutational activation by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Imatinib mesylate, is now standard treatment for metastatic GISTs. KIT exon I I mutations (in frame deletions, point mutations, and duplications) occur in GISTs of all locations, whereas a characteristic exon 9 insertion-duplication AY502-503 is nearly specific for intestinal vs gastric tumors. In contrast, PDGFRA mutations are nearly specific for gastric GISTs, especially those with epithelioid morphology. Mutation type influences therapy responsiveness, but fortunately very few GISTs carry primarily Imatimb-resistant mutations. Secondary drug resistance acquired during Imatinib treatment based on new, Imatinib-resistant mutations is a major problem limiting treatment success. Loss of NF2 tumor suppressor gene in a biallelic fashion is believed to be central in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) associated and sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas. The mechanism includes nonsense or missense mutation in NF2 gene, and loss of the other NF2 allele as a part of losses in chromosome 22q. Schwannoma types may differ in their pathogenesis: gastrointestinal schwannomas lack NF2 changes suggesting a different pathogenesis. Intraneural and sclerosing perineuriomas display similar NF2 gene alterations as seen in meningioma, indicating a similar pathogenesis and molecular homology Specific viral sequences of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) are diagnostic markers for Kaposi sarcoma (KS), and are absent in angiosarcoma. Despite discovery on simian virus SV40 sequences in mesothelioma as a possible pathogenetic factor, recent studies suggest that the presence of these sequences may be artifactual and based on common presence of some SV40 sequences as PCR contaminants.";USAF, Inst Pathol, Dept Soft Tissue Pathol, Washington, DC 20330 USA;"United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force";Miettinen, M (corresponding author), USAF, Inst Pathol, Dept Soft Tissue Pathol, Washington, DC 20330 USA.;;;;;;;;70;23;27;0;2;SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN;BERLIN;HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY;0065-2598;2214-8019;1-4020-4966-8;ADV EXP MED BIOL;Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.;;2006;587;;;;;;99;113;;;;;;15;Oncology;Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S);Oncology;BFN31;17163160;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000243248800010;View Full Record in Web of Science
