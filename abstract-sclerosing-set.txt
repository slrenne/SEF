INTRODUCTION: We encountered a unique case of a patient with two distinct tumors 
coexisting in the same thigh. To the best of our knowledge, this combination of 
tumors in the same anatomical region has not been previously described in the 
literature.
CASE REPORT: This case report describes a 38-year-old Caucasian male with a 
painless mass in his right thigh, which was later diagnosed as a hybrid tumor 
composed of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma, as well as a second tumor, which was diagnosed as a hibernoma. The 
patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical excision, followed by 
adjuvant radiotherapy and treatment for metastatic recurrence.
CONCLUSION: The rarity of this case highlights the need for interdisciplinary 
collaboration and further investigations into the behavior and management of 
hybrid tumors. This case also underscores the importance of an accurate 
histological diagnosis aided by immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses.

BACKGROUND: Low-grade Fibromyxoid Sarcoma(LGFM)is a rare fibrosarcoma, which 
mainly occurs in young people and is mostly seen in the trunk and limbs. The 
tumor is usually FUS-CREB3L2 fusion caused by t(7;16)(q32-34;p11)chromosome 
translocation, and rarely FUS-CREB3L1 and EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. MUC4 diffuse 
strong positive can be used as a specific index of LGFM. LGFM is similar to 
Sclerosing Epithelioid Fibrosarcoma(SEF) and may have the same origin.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of LGFM in the chest wall. A female who is 
59 years old. In 2016, CT showed dense nodule shadow and focal thickening of the 
left pleura, the patient underwent surgery, Pathological report that low to 
moderate malignant fibrosarcoma(fibromyxoid type). The CT re-examination in 2021 
showed that the tumors on the left chest wall were significantly larger than 
before. Pathological examination showed the disease is composed of alternating 
collagen like and mucinous areas. Under high-power microscope, the tumor cells 
are consistent in shape, spindle or short spindle, and the tumor cells are 
arranged in bundles. In local areas, the density of tumor cells is significantly 
increased, mixed with collagen fibers, and small focal SEF appear. The result of 
immunohistochemistry showed that SMA, Desmin, CD34, STAT6, S100, SOX10, HMB45 
and Melan A were negative, EMA was weakly positive, MUC4 was diffuse and 
strongly positive, and Ki67 index was low (3%).
CONCLUSION: Sequencing results showed that MET, EGFR, KMT2B and RET gene were 
mutated in LGFM, and KMT2B gene had cancer promoting effect, but there was no 
literature report in LGFM, which may be of certain significance for the 
diagnosis and treatment of LGFM.

Small cell osteosarcoma (SCOS), a variant of conventional high-grade 
osteosarcoma (COS), may mimic fusion-driven round cell sarcomas (FDRCS) by 
overlapping clinico-radiological and histomorphological/immunohistochemical 
characteristics, hampering accurate diagnosis and consequently proper therapy. 
We retrospectively analyzed decalcified formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
samples of 18 bone tumors primarily diagnosed as SCOS by methylation profiling, 
fusion gene analysis, and immunohistochemistry.In eight cases, the diagnosis of 
SCOS was maintained, and in 10 cases it was changed into FDRCS, including three 
Ewing sarcomas (EWSR1::FLI1 in two cases and no identified fusion gene in the 
third case), two sarcomas with BCOR alterations (KMT2D::BCOR, CCNB3::BCOR, 
respectively), three mesenchymal chondrosarcomas (HEY1::NCOA2 in two cases and 
one case with insufficient RNA quality), and two sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcomas (FUS::CREBL3 and EWSR1 rearrangement, 
respectively).Histologically, SCOS usually possessed more pleomorphic cells in 
contrast to the FDRCS showing mainly monomorphic cellular features. However, 
osteoid was seen in the latter tumors as well, often associated with slight 
pleomorphism. Also, the immunohistochemical profile (CD99, SATB2, and BCOR) 
overlapped.Clinically and radiologically, similarities between SCOS and FDRCS 
were observed, with by imaging only minimal presence or lack of (mineralized) 
osteoid in most of the SCOSs.In conclusion, discrimination of SCOS, 
epigenetically related to COS, versus FDRCS of bone can be challenging but is 
important due to different biology and therefore therapeutic strategies. 
Methylation profiling is a reliable and robust diagnostic test especially on 
decalcified FFPE material. Subsequent fusion gene analysis and/or use of 
specific immunohistochemical surrogate markers can be used to substantiate the 
diagnosis.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a distinctive sarcoma that may 
arise in nearly any soft tissue site or bone. While there has been past 
controversy as to whether it is related to low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma 
(LGFMS), it has been shown to behave far more aggressively than LGFMS. SEF has a 
propensity to metastasize to the lungs and bone and arise within the abdominal 
cavity. Histologically, it is characterized by uniform nuclei embedded in a 
densely collagenous stroma simulating osteoid. By immunohistochemistry, it is 
often strongly positive for MUC4. The majority (75%) have EWSR1 gene 
rearrangement, most commonly with CREB3L1 as a fusion partner, although a 
variety of FUS/EWSR1 and CREB3L1/CREB3L2/CREB3L3 fusions have been described in 
addition to others. SEF is currently recalcitrant to nearly all chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy.

Background Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) and sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma (SEF) are two rare but aggressive soft tissue sarcomas that can be 
difficult to distinguish due to histopathological similarities. The present 
study examines the diagnostic capacities of mucin-4 (MUC4), a transmembrane 
mucin, in identifying different types of sarcomas and broadens its evaluation to 
include a wide range of sarcomas. Methods Immunohistochemical (IHC) examination 
of tissue samples from various sarcomas was performed using a mouse anti-MUC4 
monoclonal antibody. IHC was conducted on 4-mm thick formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tissue sections after pressure cooker antigen retrieval with a 
mouse anti-MUC4 monoclonal antibody. Results MUC4 was shown to be highly 
expressed in SEF (n=13) and LGFMS (n=10), while focal positivity in synovial 
sarcoma (n=1). Other sarcomas, such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 
fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma, exhibited no 
expression (n=0). These findings are consistent with previous research and 
support MUC4 specificity as a SEF and LGFMS marker. This study provides 
information on the diagnostic efficacy of MUC4, particularly in the context of 
certain subtypes. It not only helps our understanding of these unique instances, 
but it also provides context for histopathological and IHC findings in soft 
tissue sarcoma. Furthermore, this study investigates the influence of age and 
gender on MUC4 expression in a range of sarcomas, which was typically 
understudied in the literature and found no relation with expression of MUC4. 
Conclusion In conclusion, this study adds to our understanding of soft tissue 
sarcomas by emphasizing the crucial role of MUC4 in certain sarcoma subtypes 
while acknowledging the complex variety of the sarcoma landscape. Further 
research is needed to understand the molecular mechanism that governs marker 
expression patterns, as well as the therapeutic implications.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and 
adolescents under the age of 20. The current World Health Organization (WHO) 
classification for soft tissue and bone tumors recognizes 4 distinct subtypes of 
RMS based on clinicopathological and molecular genetic features: embryonal, 
alveolar, spindle cell/sclerosing and pleomorphic subtypes. However, with the 
increased use of molecular techniques, the classification of rhabdomyosarcoma 
has been evolving rapidly. New subtypes such as osseus RMS harboring TFCP2/NCOA2 
fusions or RMS arising in inflammatory rhabdomyoblastic tumor have been emerging 
within the last decade, adding to the complexity of diagnosing skeletal muscle 
tumors. This review article provides an overview of classically recognized 
distinctive subtypes as well as new, evolving subtypes and discusses important 
morphologic, immunophenotypic and molecular genetic features of each subtype 
including recommendations for a diagnostic approach of malignant skeletal muscle 
neoplasms.

AIMS: Spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcomas (SS-RMS) are clinically and 
genetically heterogeneous. They include three well-defined molecular subtypes, 
of which those with EWSR1/FUS::TFCP2 rearrangements were described only 
recently. This study aimed to evaluate five new cases of SS-RMS and to perform a 
clinicopathological and statistical analysis of all TFCP2-rearranged SS-RMS 
described in the English literature to more comprehensively characterize this 
rare tumour type.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Cases were retrospectively selected and studied by 
immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization with EWSR1/FUS and 
TFCP2 break-apart probes, next-generation sequencing (Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma 
kit and TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel). The PubMed database was searched for 
relevant peer-reviewed English reports. Five cases of SS-RMS were found. Three 
cases were TFCP2 rearranged SS-RMS, having FUSex6::TFCP2ex2 gene fusion in two 
cases and triple gene fusion EWSR1ex5::TFCP2ex2, VAX2ex2::ALKex2 and 
VAX2intron2::ALKex2 in one case. Two cases showed rhabdomyoblastic 
differentiation and spindle-round cell/sclerosing morphology, but were 
characterized by novel genetic fusions including EWSR1ex8::ZBTB41ex7 and 
PLOD2ex8::RBM6ex7, respectively. In the statistical analysis of all published 
cases, CDKN2A or ALK alterations, the use of standard chemotherapy and age at 
presentation in the range of 18-24 years were negatively correlated to overall 
survival.
CONCLUSION: EWSR1/FUS::TFCP2-rearranged SS-RMS is a rare rhabdomyosarcoma 
subtype, affecting predominantly young adults with average age at presentation 
34 years (median 29.5 years; age range 7-86 years), with a predilection for 
craniofacial bones, rapid clinical course with frequent bone and lung 
metastases, and poor prognosis (3-year overall survival rate 28%).

Sclerosing Epithelioid Fibrosarcoma (SEF) and Low Grade Fibromyxoid Sarcoma 
(LGFMS) are ultrarare sarcomas sharing common translocations whose natural 
history are not well known. We report on the nationwide exhaustive series of 330 
patients with SEF or LGFMS in NETSARC+ since 2010.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: NETSARC (netsarc.org) is a network of 26 reference sarcoma 
centers with specialized multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTB). Since 2010, (i) 
pathological review has been mandatory for sarcoma,and (ii) tumour/patients' 
characteristics have been collected in the NETSARC+ nationwide database. The 
characteristics of patients with SEF and LGFMS and their outcome are compared.
RESULTS: 35/73 (48%) and 125/257(49%) of patients with SEF and LGFMS were 
female. More visceral, bone and trunk primary sites were observed in SEF 
(p < 0.001). 30% of SEF vs 4% of LGFMS patients had metastasis at diagnosis 
(p < 0.0001). Median size of the primary tumor was 51 mm (range 10-90) for LGFMS 
vs 80 (20-320) for SEF (p < 0.001). Median age for LGFMS patients was 12 years 
younger than that of SEF patients (43 [range 4-98] vs 55 [range 10-91], 
p < 0.001). Neoadjuvant treatment was more often given to SEF (16% vs 9%, 
p = 0.05). More patients with LGFMS were operated first in reference centers 
(51% vs 26%, p < 0.001). The R0 rate on the operative specimen was 41% in LGFMS 
vs 16% in SEF (p < 0.001). Median event-free survival (EFS) of patients with SEF 
and LGFMS were 32 vs 136 months (p < 0.0001). The median overall survival (OS) 
was not reached. Fifty-months OS was 93% vs 81% for LGFMS vs SEF (p = 0.05). 
Median OS was 77 months after first relapse, similar for SEF and LGFMS. In 
multivariate analysis, age, tumor size, metastasis at diagnosis were independent 
prognostic factors for OS in LGFMS.
CONCLUSIONS: Although sharing close molecular alterations, SEF and LGFMS have a 
different natural history, clinical presentation and outcome, with a higher risk 
of metastatic relapse in SEF. Survival after relapse is longer than with other 
sarcomas, and similar for SEF and LGFMS.

Synovial sarcoma is a relatively common soft tissue tumor characterized by 
highly specific t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation resulting in the fusion of SS18 
with members of SSX gene family. Typically, detection of SS18 locus 
rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization or SS18 :: SSX fusion 
transcripts confirms the diagnosis. More recently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
for SS18-SSX chimeric protein (E9X9V) and C-terminus of SSX (E5A2C) showed high 
specificity and sensitivity for synovial sarcoma. This study screened a cohort 
of >1000 soft tissue and melanocytic tumors using IHC and E9X9V and E5A2C 
antibodies. Three percent (6/212) of synovial sarcomas were either negative for 
SS18-SSX or had scattered positive tumor cells (n=1). In these cases, targeted 
RNA next-generation sequencing detected variants of SS18 :: SSX chimeric 
transcripts. DNA methylation profiles of 2 such tumors matched with synovial 
sarcoma. A few nonsynovial sarcoma tumors (n=6) revealed either focal SS18-SSX 
positivity (n=1) or scattered positive tumor cells. However, targeted RNA 
next-generation sequencing failed to detect SS18 :: SSX transcripts in these 
cases. The nature of this immunopositivity remains elusive and may require 
single cell sequencing studies. All synovial sarcomas showed positive SSX IHC. 
However, a mosaic staining pattern or focal loss of expression was noticed in a 
few cases. Strong and diffuse SSX immunoreactivity was also seen in epithelioid 
sclerosing osteosarcoma harboring EWSR1 :: SSX1 fusion, while several sarcomas 
and melanocytic tumors including cellular blue nevus (5/7, 71%) revealed focal 
to diffuse, mostly weak to intermediate SSX staining. The SS18-SSX and SSX IHC 
is a useful tool for synovial sarcoma differential diagnosis, but unusual 
immunophenotype should trigger molecular genetic testing.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) occurring as a primary bone tumor is 
exceptionally uncommon. Even more rare are cases of SEF that show morphologic 
overlap with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). Such hybrid lesions arising 
within the bone have only rarely been reported in the literature. Due to their 
variegated histomorphology and non-specific radiologic features, these tumors 
may pose diagnostic difficulties. Herein we describe three molecularly confirmed 
primary bone cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma that demonstrated 
prominent areas showing the features of LGFMS and with areas resembling 
so-called hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes (HSCTGR). Two 
patients were female and one was male aged 26, 47, and 16, respectively. The 
tumors occurred in the femoral head, clavicle, and temporal bone. Imaging 
studies demonstrated relatively well-circumscribed radiolucent bone lesions with 
enhancement on MRI. Cortical breakthrough and soft tissue extension were present 
in one case. Histologically the tumors all demonstrated hyalinized areas with 
SEF-like morphology as well as spindled and myxoid areas with LGFMS-like 
morphology. Two cases demonstrated focal areas with rosette-like architecture as 
seen in HSCTGR. The tumors were all positive for MUC4 by immunohistochemistry 
and cytogenetics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization, and next-generation 
sequencing studies identified EWSR1 gene rearrangements confirming the diagnosis 
in all three cases.Hybrid SEF is exceedingly rare as a primary bone tumor and 
can be difficult to distinguish from other low-grade spindled and epithelioid 
lesions of bone. MUC4 positivity and identification of underlying EWSR1 gene 
rearrangements help support this diagnosis and exclude other tumor types.

Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors are a variable group of neoplasms 
ranging from benign to malignant. These lesions may affect patients of any age 
group but are more frequently encountered in the pediatric population. Patient 
clinical presentation depends on the location, growth pattern, adjacent 
soft-tissue involvement, and pathologic behavior of these neoplasms. In the 2020 
update to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, these 
tumors are classified on the basis of their distinct biologic behavior, 
histomorphologic characteristics, and molecular profiles into four tumor 
categories: (a) benign (eg, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, nodular fasciitis, 
proliferative fasciitis, fibroma of the tendon sheath, calcifying aponeurotic 
fibroma); (b) intermediate, locally aggressive (eg, desmoid fibromatosis); (c) 
intermediate, rarely metastasizing (eg, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 
myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, 
infantile fibrosarcoma); and (d) malignant (eg, sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcomas; low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma; myxofibrosarcoma; fibrosarcoma, 
not otherwise specified). Detection of various components of solid tumors at 
imaging can help in prediction of the presence of corresponding histopathologic 
variations, thus influencing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. For 
example, lesions with a greater myxoid matrix or necrotic components tend to 
show higher signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, whereas lesions with 
hypercellularity and dense internal collagen content display low signal 
intensity. In addition, understanding the radiologic-pathologic correlation of 
soft-tissue tumors can help to increase the accuracy of percutaneous biopsy and 
allow unnecessary interventions to be avoided. ©RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for

Histiocytic, dendritic, and stromal cell lesions that occur in the spleen are 
challenging diagnostically, not well studied due to their rarity, and therefore 
somewhat controversial. New techniques for obtaining tissue samples also create 
challenges as splenectomy is no longer common and needle biopsy does not afford 
the same opportunity for examination of tissue. Characteristic primary splenic 
histiocytic, dendritic, and stromal cell lesions are presented in this paper 
with new molecular genetic findings in some entities that help differentiate 
these lesions from those occurring in non-splenic sites, such as soft tissue, 
and identify possible molecular markers for diagnosis.

Major progress in recent decades has furthered our clinical and biological 
understanding of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with improved stratification for 
treatment based on risk factors. Clinical risk factors alone were used to 
stratify patients for treatment in the European Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma 
Study Group (EpSSG) RMS 2005 protocol. The current EpSSG overarching study for 
children and adults with frontline and relapsed rhabdomyosarcoma (FaR-RMS 
NCT04625907) includes FOXO1 fusion gene status in place of histology as a risk 
factor. Additional molecular features of significance have recently been 
recognized, including the MYOD1L122R gene mutation. Here, we review biological 
information showing that MYOD1L122R blocks cell differentiation and has a 
MYC-like activity that enhances tumorigenesis and is linked to an aggressive 
cellular phenotype. MYOD1L122R mutations can be found together with mutations in 
other genes, such as PIK3CA, as potentially cooperating events. Using Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 
ten publications in the clinical literature involving 72 cases were reviewed. 
MYOD1L122R mutation in RMS can occur in both adults and children and is frequent 
in sclerosing/spindle cell histology, although it is also significantly reported 
in a subset of embryonal RMS. MYOD1L122R mutated tumors most frequently arise in 
the head and neck and extremities and are associated with poor outcome, raising 
the issue of how to use MYOD1L122R in risk stratification and how to treat these 
patients most effectively.

The recently described KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas are rare emerging entities 
where the KMT2A gene fuses with YAP1 and, less commonly, VIM, resulting in two 
distinct morphologies. Unlike the sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like 
features that characterize tumors with KMT2A::YAP1 fusions, 
VIM::KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas are more uniformly cellular and lack the 
extensively sclerotic background seen in the former. Most tumors behave 
aggressively with metastases on presentation. Here, we describe the 
clinicopathologic and molecular findings in two additional cases of VIM::KMT2A 
rearranged sarcomas that arose in the deep soft tissues of adult males. Both 
tumors were composed of hypercellular fascicles of uniform spindle cells with 
pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and ovoid nuclei. The stroma had scant delicate 
collagen with occasional thin-walled ectatic blood vessels and perivascular 
hyalinization. Immunohistochemical studies showed an unspecific staining pattern 
with diffuse positivity for CD99 and BCL2 and variable staining for S100 
protein. RNA-sequencing detected the presence of VIM::KMT2A gene fusion 
involving VIM exon 4 and KMT2A exon 2 in both cases. Sarcomas with VIM::KMT2A 
gene fusions seem to have sufficient morphologic features to warrant distinction 
from KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas with YAP1 partner. Without the benefit of 
molecular testing, these tumors pose a diagnostic challenge due to their lack of 
specific immunohistochemical profile and great morphologic overlap with other 
monomorphic spindle cell neoplasms.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and 
represents a high-grade neoplasm of skeletal myoblast-like cells. About 40% of 
all registered soft tissue tumors are RMSs. This paper describes our current 
understanding of the RMS subtypes (alveolar (ARMS), embryonic (ERMS), 
pleomorphic (PRMS), and spindle cell/sclerosing (s/scRMS)), diagnostic methods, 
molecular bases, and characteristics. We also present the currently used 
treatment methods and the potential use of natural substances in the treatment 
of this type of cancer. Natural cytotoxic substances are compounds that have 
been the subject of numerous studies and discussions in recent years. Since 
anti-cancer therapies are often limited by a low therapeutic index and cancer 
resistance to pharmacotherapy, it is very important to search for new, effective 
compounds. Additionally, compounds of a natural origin are usually readily 
available and have a reduced cytotoxicity. Thus, the undiscovered potential of 
natural anti-cancer compounds makes this field of research a very important 
area. The introduction of model species into research examining the use of 
natural cytostatic therapies for RMS will allow for further assessment of the 
effects of these compounds on cancerous and healthy tissues.

AIMS: Rhabdomyosarcomas currently are classified into one of four subtypes 
(alveolar, embryonal, spindle cell/sclerosing, or pleomorphic) according to 
their morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic features. The 
alveolar subtype is characterised by a recurrent translocation involving PAX3 or 
PAX7 and FOXO1; identification of this translocation is important for 
appropriate classification and prognostication. In this study, we aimed to 
explore the diagnostic utility of FOXO1 immunohistochemistry for 
rhabdomyosarcoma classification.
METHODS/RESULTS: A monoclonal antibody targeting a FOXO1 epitope retained in the 
fusion oncoprotein was used to study 105 rhabdomyosarcomas. FOXO1 was positive 
for expression by immunohistochemistry in all 25 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, 
with 84% showing diffuse expression in greater than 90% of neoplastic cells; the 
remainder of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas displayed at least moderate staining in 
a minimum of 60% of lesional cells. Apart from three spindle cell 
rhabdomyosarcomas showing heterogeneous nuclear immunoreactivity in 40-80% of 
tumour cells, the 80 cases of embryonal, pleomorphic, and spindle 
cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma were negative for FOXO1 expression (96.3% 
specific) when using a threshold of nuclear staining in 20% of neoplastic cells 
to determine positivity. Variable cytoplasmic staining was present in a fraction 
of all rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes. Nonneoplastic lymphocytes, endothelial cells, 
and Schwann cells also showed variably intense nuclear anti-FOXO1 
immunoreactivity.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings suggest that FOXO1 immunohistochemistry 
is a highly sensitive and relatively specific surrogate marker of the 
PAX3/7::FOXO1 fusion oncoprotein in rhabdomyosarcoma. Cytoplasmic 
immunoreactivity, expression in nonneoplastic tissues, and limited nuclear 
staining of nonalveolar rhabdomyosarcomas represent potential pitfalls in 
interpretation.

We present a case series of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) to further 
characterise its clinical and pathological features. Twenty-one patients with 
SEF were included in this study. There were 12 males and nine females (range 
25-63 years; median 38 years). Tumours were located in the kidney (n=5), thigh 
(n=3), chest wall (n=3), head and neck (n=2), bone (n=2), abdominal wall (n=1), 
psoas major (n=1), retroperitoneum (n=1), omentum (n=1), popliteal space (n=1) 
and lung (n=1). Tumour sizes ranged from 2.5 to 16 cm (median 7 cm). 
Microscopically, epithelioid tumour cells were arranged in nests and cords and 
embedded in a dense sclerotic stroma. Some tumours showed myxoid areas, 
fibroma-like areas, acinar growth patterns and haemangiopericytoma-like 
appearance. A few tumour cells presented a rhabdomyoid shape. Calcification, 
ossification, cystic and necrosis were observed in some cases. The diagnosis was 
confirmed by immunoreactivity for MUC4, and by further fluorescence in situ 
hybridisation (FISH) or next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Clinical 
follow-up was available for 16 cases (median, 24 months; range 6-62 months). 
Seven patients developed metastases to lung (n=3), bone (n=3), brain (n=2) and 
back (n=1). Four patients developed a local recurrence. Three patients died of 
disease. Overall survival (OS) of SEF was related to patient age (p=0.001) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) was related to tumour size (p=0.046). In 
addition to soft tissue, SEF is more likely to involve the viscera and the 
abdominal cavity and has morphological variants. Familiarity with its 
distinctive clinical and pathological features helps avoid misdiagnosis.

Both clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (CCOC) and sclerosing odontogenic 
carcinoma (SOC) are rare odontogenic malignancies. Here, we report a case of 
maxillary CCOC whose clinical and histologic features resembled those of SOC. 
Radiologically, the tumor presented as an ill-defined, expansile radiolucency 
with local bone destruction. Histologically, the tumor was comprised of thin 
cords or strands of odontogenic epithelium permeating through a sclerosed 
fibrous stroma with occasional clear cell foci. It damaged the cortical plates 
and invaded the adjacent soft tissue. Immunohistochemical expression of 
Pancytokeratin, Cytokeratin 19, p63, Cytokeratin 5/6, and Cytokeratin 14, as 
well as focal expression of Cytokeratin 7, demonstrated the epithelial nature of 
the tumor. Alcian Blue Periodic acid Schiff staining revealed a lack of 
intracellular mucin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed Ewing 
sarcoma RNA binding protein 1 and activating transcription factor 1 gene 
translocation, further confirming the diagnosis of CCOC. Lastly, we 
contextualized the genetic analysis of our case to that of CCOC in the 
literature.

BACKGROUND: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an extremely rare 
subtype of soft tissue sarcoma and the data from India is sparse. It is an 
unusual variant of fibrosarcoma that commonly arises in the soft tissues of the 
limb, head and neck, trunk and occasionally in the visceral organs and bones. 
This entity is commonly reported in the middle age group, men and women alike. 
Pathological clinchers include MUC 4 (Mucin 4, cell surface associated) 
positivity by immunohistochemistry, FUS-CREB3L1 fusion and EWSR1 rearrangement. 
This disease is notoriously known for its local recurrence and metastatic 
spread. Response to systemic therapy is poor and relapses are frequent. The role 
of targeted and immunotherapy is not well defined.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a 46-year-old gentleman who presented to the 
Sarcoma Medical Oncology Clinic in our centre. He had primary involvement of 
right pubic bone with metastasis to liver, lung and diffuse lytic bony lesions. 
His diagnosis was reviewed multiple times before coming to final diagnosis of 
SEF. His molecular test for EWSR1 rearrangement was positive by fluorescence 
in-situ hybridisation. He did not respond to palliative doxorubicin, pazopanib 
and gemcitabine and docetaxel.
CONCLUSION: Through this case report, we would like to highlight the rarity of 
this sarcoma, its classical pathological features, its close relationship to 
low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and the limited therapeutic options available. 
Hence, there is a need for further research in this entity.

PURPOSE: Recently, the Connective Tissue Oncology Society published consensus 
guidelines for recognizing ultrarare sarcomas (URS), defined as sarcomas with an 
incidence ≤1 per 1,000,000. We assessed the outcomes of 56 patients with soft 
tissue, and 21 with bone sarcomas, enrolled in Phase 1 trials.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this Sarcoma-Matched Biomarker Analysis (SAMBA-102 
study), we reviewed records from patients on Phase 1 trials at the University of 
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 2013 and June 2021.
RESULTS: Among 587 sarcomas, 106 (18.1%) were classified as URS. Fifty (47%) 
were male, and the median age was 44.3 years (range, 19-82). The most common 
subtypes were alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), chordoma, dedifferentiated 
chondrosarcoma, and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. Compared with common 
sarcomas, median OS was similar 16.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 
13.6-17.5] versus 16.1 (95% CI, 8.2-24.0) in URS (P = 0.359). Objective response 
to treatment was higher in URS 13.2% (n = 14/106) compared with common sarcomas 
6.9% (n = 33/481; P = 0.029). Median OS for those treated on matched trials was 
27.3 months (95% CI, 1.9-52.7) compared with 13.4 months (95% CI, 6.3-20.6) for 
those not treated on matched trials (P = 0.291). Eight of 33 (24%) molecularly 
matched treatments resulted in an objective response, whereas 6 of 73 unmatched 
treatments (8.2%) resulted in an objective response (P = 0.024). Clinical 
benefit rate was 36.4% (12/33) in matched trials versus 26.0% (19/73) in 
unmatched trials (P = 0.279).
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the benefit of genomic selection in Phase 1 
trials to help identify molecular subsets likely to benefit from targeted 
therapy.

Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are the most common soft tissue sarcomas in 
children/adolescents less than 18 years of age with an annual incidence of 
1-2/million. Inter/intra-tumour heterogeneity raise challenges in clinical, 
pathological and biological research studies. Risk stratification in European 
and North American clinical trials previously relied on clinico-pathological 
features, but now, incorporates PAX3/7-FOXO1-fusion gene status in the place of 
alveolar histology. International working groups propose a coordinated approach 
through the INternational Soft Tissue SaRcoma ConsorTium to evaluate the 
specific genetic abnormalities and generate and integrate molecular and clinical 
data related to patients with RMS across different trial settings. We review 
relevant data and present a consensus view on what molecular features should be 
assessed. In particular, we recommend the assessment of the MYOD1-LR122R 
mutation for risk escalation, as it has been associated with poor outcomes in 
spindle/sclerosing RMS and rare RMS with classic embryonal histopathology. The 
prospective analyses of rare fusion genes beyond PAX3/7-FOXO1 will generate new 
data linked to outcomes and assessment of TP53 mutations and CDK4 amplification 
may confirm their prognostic value. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline 
variants in TP53 and other cancer predisposition genes should also be assessed. 
DNA/RNA profiling of tumours at diagnosis/relapse and serial analyses of plasma 
samples is recommended where possible to validate potential molecular 
biomarkers, identify new biomarkers and assess how liquid biopsy analyses can 
have the greatest benefit. Together with the development of new 
molecularly-derived therapeutic strategies that we review, a synchronised 
international approach is expected to enhance progress towards improved 
treatment assignment, management and outcomes for patients with RMS.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare subtype of soft tissue 
tumors, and SEF originating from the side of the spine is even rarer. We report 
that a 28-year-old young woman suffered from chest pain and back pain for 3 
years, and thereafter she went to see a doctor because her condition 
deteriorated. Enhanced CT showed that the right posterior upper chest wall mass 
invaded the adjacent bone, and the boundary between the lesion and the 
surrounding tissues was relatively clear. She then underwent posterior tumor 
removal surgery. The pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of SEF. In 
histomorphology, the tumor displayed a typical epithelioid clear cell 
morphology, accompanied by extensive vitrification and fibrosis, which better 
helped to differentiate the tumor from low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, solitary 
fibrous tumor and other entities. The immunohistochemical analysis showed a 
diffuse positive reaction to MUC4, a highly specific marker of SEF, which was 
detected by Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescence in-situ hybridization 
(FISH) confirmed that the EWSR1 gene was rearranged, while the FUS gene was not 
rearranged. This is the first time that we have encountered such this rare case 
and thus report this case with updated literature related to this tumor.

In the present report, we describe a case of sclerosing orbital pseudotumor in 
an 11-year-old castrated male American Shorthair cat. Ophthalmic exam showed 
lagophthalmos, retracted right upper eyelid, and resistant to retropulsion in 
his right eye. Under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, increased volume of 
the extraocular muscles (EOMs) of the right eye was prominent. Immunosuppressive 
dosage of prednisolone partially ameliorated the clinical signs, but some 
clinical signs were still gradually progressive or persistent. In the second MRI 
scan, decreased diameter of the thickened right extraocular muscles was found. 
After the third MRI scan, enucleation of the right eye was performed due to 
substantial adverse effects of systemic steroid therapy. Histopathological 
examination revealed no evidence of neoplastic transformation nor infection. 
Feline restrictive orbital myofibroblastic sarcoma (FROMS) was therefore 
excluded, suggesting unknown causes of extensive fibrotic changes in the right 
orbit of the affected cat.

In the past decade, several emerging bone and soft tissue neoplasms of the head 
and neck region have been described in the literature, including GLI1-altered 
mesenchymal tumors, (intraosseous) rhabdomyosarcoma with TFCP2 fusion, and 
adamantinoma-like Ewing sarcoma. This review provides a summary of the clinical 
features, histologic characteristics, immunoprofile, key diagnostic features, 
and differential diagnoses of these emerging entities. Notably, all three 
entities show epithelioid morphology and cytokeratin immunopositivity, 
highlighting the need to consider these mesenchymal neoplasms in the 
differential diagnoses of cytokeratin-positive epithelioid tumors in the head 
and neck region. Appropriate workups including detection of the characteristic 
molecular alterations are essential for the correct diagnosis.

NTRK-rearranged mesenchymal neoplasms mostly affect the soft tissues of 
pediatric patients. Given the responsiveness to selective NTRK inhibitors, it 
remains critical to identify those ultra-rare cases occurring in the viscera of 
adults. In five females and two males aged 18-53 years, we characterized 
visceral mesenchymal tumors harboring TPM3-NTRK1 [uterine cervix (N = 2), 
pleura, prostate], LMNA-NTRK1 (lung), SQSTM1-NTRK3 (heart), and NTRK3 
rearrangement with unknown fusion partner (colon/mesocolon) with RNA sequencing, 
FISH, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. The tumors exhibited spindled to 
ovoid/epithelioid or pleomorphic cells, often arranged in fascicles, and were 
low-to-intermediate-grade and high-grade in three and four cases, respectively. 
Keloid-like stromal collagen and perivascular hyalinization was noted in five. 
Adenosarcoma-like appearances were observed in two, manifesting frond-like 
protrusions in one cervical tumor and phyllodes-like architecture in the 
prostatic tumor. Abrupt high-grade transformation into pleomorphic liposarcoma 
was found in another cervical tumor, while the pleural tumor contained 
intermixed rhabdomyoblasts. Pan-TRK immunostaining was positive in all cases. 
All cases expressed CD34, while five were S100-positive. CDKN2A homozygous 
deletion with concomitant p16 loss occurred in 4/7. Whole-exome sequencing 
identified TP53 mutation (c.672+2T>C, involving a splice site, with concomitant 
protein loss) in a cervical sarcoma, limited to its heterologous liposarcomatous 
component. At least moderate pan-TRK immunoreactivity was present in varying 
proportions of potential pathologic mimics, with BCOR-positive sarcoma (56%, 
5/9), undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (50%, 3/6), and spindle cell/sclerosing 
rhabdomyosarcoma (33%, 2/6) being among the most frequent. This underscored the 
unsatisfactory specificity of pan-TRK immunohistochemistry and warranted 
molecular confirmation in the diagnosis of adult NTRK-rearranged visceral 
mesenchymal neoplasms. The current report highlights the ever-expanding 
clinicopathologic and genetic spectrum of this entity by describing the 
unprecedented cardiac and pleural locations and heterologous differentiation, as 
well as the second NTRK-rearranged "prostatic stromal sarcoma," while 
substantiating CDKN2A deletion as a frequent occurrence.

CONTEXT.—: Rhabdomyosarcoma, the most common soft tissue sarcoma of children, is 
currently classified into the following 4 subtypes: embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, 
alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma, and 
pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, based on recent molecular genetic knowledge and 
morphologic features.
OBJECTIVE.—: To highlight the most recent advances of molecular genetic 
alterations, and to familiarize pathologists with most recent genotype and 
phenotype correlation in rhabdomyosarcoma.
DATA SOURCES.—: Data were derived from the World Health Organization 
Classification of Soft Tissue and Bone Tumors, fifth edition, recently published 
literature (PubMed), and clinical practice experience.
CONCLUSIONS.—: Current classification has been significantly impacted by 
genotype and phenotype correlation, especially with PAX-FOXO1 fusion-positive 
rhabdomyosarcoma versus fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma, and with the emergence 
of 3 distinct new subtypes of spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma. Although 
all rhabdomyosarcomas were considered a single diagnostic entity in the past, 
they are now considered to be a group of histologically similar but biologically 
diverse entities because their clinical behavior and underlying molecular 
alterations dramatically differ. This review outlines recent molecular genetic 
developments, corresponding morphologic features, and current challenges faced 
by pathologists in daily practice.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF), typically arising in middle-aged and 
older adults, is a rare malignant fibroblastic neoplasm characterized by 
epithelioid fibroblasts embedded in sclerotic hyalinized stroma. This tumor 
frequently harbors translocation between EWSR1 and CREB3 subfamily members. 
Here, we describe four cases of SEF with unique genetic characteristics in 
children. All tumors were located in the deep soft tissue of the trunk and 
celom. Histopathologically, the tumors were featured by prominent hyalinized 
sclerotic collagenous stroma within which relatively bland and monomorphic 
epithelioid cells were arranged in cords, nests, or sheets. Low-grade 
fibromyxoid sarcoma-like zones varied among cases. MUC4 was strong and diffuse. 
CD99 was positive. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated spindle or 
polyhedral neoplastic cells with a collagen fiber-rich stroma. Interphase 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed local amplification of the 
EWSR1 locus. Whole-genome sequencing indicated translocation between EWSR1 and 
CREB3L1 together with low-level amplification of the fusion parts. RT-PCR and 
Sanger sequencing confirmed the fusion transcript. Single nucleotide 
polymorphism and FISH analyses demonstrated co-deletion of 11p and 22q. The 
consistent genetic features indicated the presence of a unique molecular variant 
of SEF. DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT: The data used to support the findings of 
this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.

Adult rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) represents an uncommon entity with an incidence of 
less than 3% of all soft tissue sarcomas (STS). Consequently, the natural 
history and the clinical management of this disease are infrequently reported. 
In order to fill this gap, we investigated the molecular biology of an adult RMS 
case series. The expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition-related gene 
and chemoresistance-related gene panels were evaluated. Moreover, taking 
advantage of our STS translational model combining patient-derived primary 
culture and 3D-scaffold, the pharmacological profile of an adult head and neck 
sclerosing RMS was assessed. Furthermore, NGS, microsatellite instability, and 
in silico analyses were carried out. RT-PCR identified the upregulation of CDH1, 
SLUG, MMP9, RAB22a, S100P, and LAPTM4b, representing promising biomarkers for 
this disease. Pharmacological profiling showed the highest sensitivity with 
anthracycline-based regimen in both 2D and 3D culture systems. NGS analysis 
detected RAB3IP-HMGA2 in frame gene rearrangement and FGFR4 mutation; 
microsatellite instability analysis did not detect any alteration. In silico 
analysis confirmed the mutation of FGFR4 as a promising marker for poor 
prognosis and a potential therapeutic target. We report for the first time the 
molecular and pharmacological characterization of rare entities of adult head 
and neck and posterior trunk RMS. These preliminary data could shed light on 
this poorly understood disease.

Mimickers of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) include a number of important 
pitfall tumors. Here, we describe our experience with mesenchymal mimics of NENs 
to illustrate their spectrum and draw the attention particularly to a group of 
mesenchymal/non-epithelial neoplasms (MN) that combine epithelioid histology 
with neuroendocrine (NE-) features and peculiar genetic abnormalities. In a 
consultation series of 4498 cases collected between 2009 and 2021, 2099 
neoplasms expressing synaptophysin and/or chromograninA were reviewed and 
analyzed. A total of 364 (18%) were diagnosed as non-NENs, while the remaining 
tumors were NEN. The group of mesenchymal/non-epithelial neoplasms with 
NE-features (MN-NE) included 31/364 (8%) cases. These mostly malignant neoplasms 
showed an epithelioid morphology. While all but one tumor expressed 
synaptophysin, mostly patchy, only 10/29 (34%) co-expressed chromograninA. A 
total of 13/31 (42%) of the MN-NE showed EWSR1-related gene fusions (6 Ewing 
sarcomas, 5 clear cell sarcomas, and 1 desmoplastic small round cell tumor, 1 
neoplasm with FUS-CREM gene fusion) and 7 (23%) were SWI/SNF (SMARCB1 or 
SMARCA4)-deficient neoplasms. The remaining MN-NE included synovial sarcoma, 
sclerosing epithelioid mesenchymal neoplasm, melanoma, alveolar soft part 
sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, and chordoma. A total of 27/31 MN-NE were from 
the last 8 years, and 6 of them were located in the pancreas. Eleven MN-NE were 
initially diagnosed as neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). MN-NE with epithelioid 
features play an increasing role as mimickers of NECs. They mostly belong to 
tumors with gene fusions involving the EWSR1 gene, or with SWI/SNF complex 
deficiency. Synaptophysin expression is mostly patchy and chromograninA 
expression is infrequent in MN-NE of this series and data extracted from 
literature.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is a rare subclass of sarcoma. 
Histologically, they are characterized by bland-appearing fibroblastic spindle 
cells and are similar to sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) subtype. The 
standard treatment of this aggressive tumor subtype is surgical removal with 
wide excision in conjunction with doxorubicin chemotherapy. Due to the rarity of 
this disease, effective systemic therapies are lacking and patient outcomes 
remain poor. Herein, we report on a 50-year-old male who presented with severe 
shortness of breath. Subsequent imaging revealed pericardial effusion and large 
mediastinal mass consistent with locally advanced disease. Fine needle biopsy 
demonstrated malignant, Ewing-like round tumor cells. Further genetic analysis 
affirmed the presence of FUS-CREB3L2 gene fusion. The patient was treated with 
doxorubicin and survival time from the initial presentation was five months. To 
date, there are limited reports of this disease. Few targeted therapies or 
immunotherapies for LGFMS exist, and a dire need for new therapy development 
remains.

AIMS: PRRX1-NCOA1-rearranged fibroblastic tumour is a recently described, rare 
mesenchymal tumour. Only four cases have been previously reported. The aim of 
this article is to report six additional cases of this unusual mesenchymal 
neoplasm, with an emphasis on its differential diagnosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The six cases were from three females and three males (age, 
20-49 years; median, 42 years). Three tumours were located on the abdominal 
wall; two from the shoulder/axillary areas, and one on the lateral hip. All 
presented as slow-growing subcutaneous nodules, ranging from 26 to 55 mm 
(median, 40 mm). The tumours consisted of circumscribed, variably cellular 
nodules composed of relatively bland plump spindled to epithelioid cells 
arranged singly, in cords, and occasionally in nests, embedded in hyalinised and 
collagenous stroma. Small hypocellular myxoid zones with ropey collagen fibres 
were present, as were irregularly dilated, gaping, crescent-shaped or 
staghorn-like thin-walled vessels, best appreciated at the periphery. 
Immunohistochemistry for CD34, S100, MUC4 and STAT6 was consistently negative. 
RNA-sequencing revealed PRRX1-NCOA1 fusions in all cases. Of the four cases with 
limited follow-up (1.5-4 months), none recurred following local surgical 
excision.
CONCLUSIONS: The morphological features of PRRX1-NCOA1-rearranged fibroblastic 
tumour overlap with those of RB1-deficient soft-tissue tumours, solitary fibrous 
tumour, and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma/sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. 
This differential diagnosis can be resolved with a combination of careful 
morphological study and the application of a panel of immunostains, although 
molecular genetic study is most definitive. The natural history of 
PRRX1-NCOA1-rearranged fibroblastic tumour appears to be quite favourable, 
although longer-term study of a larger number of cases is warranted.

BACKGROUND: The literature on bone and soft tissue sarcomas (BSTSs) involving 
effusions and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is very limited.
METHODS: A computerized search for fluid cytology with a sarcoma diagnosis from 
2000 to 2020 was performed. All available cases, including the clinical 
follow-up, were reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 57 fluids specimens from 36 BSTSs were identified (9 
rhabdomyosarcomas, 6 angiosarcomas, 5 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, 3 
dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 2 chondrosarcomas, 1 extraskeletal myxoid 
chondrosarcoma, 3 Ewing sarcomas, 2 undifferentiated sarcomas, 3 osteosarcomas, 
1 synovial sarcoma, and 1 hybrid low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma/sclerosing 
epithelioid fibrosarcoma). There were 22 males and 14 females. The age range was 
4 to 82 years (median, 45 years). Sites of involvement included pleural fluid (n 
= 38), peritoneal fluid (n = 14), and CSF (n = 5). Twenty-four cytology cases 
were available for review. The cytologic features were nonspecific and ranged 
from dyshesive to clusters of round, epithelioid, pleomorphic, and occasionally 
spindle-shaped malignant cells that could easily mimic other non-BSTS malignant 
tumors. The diagnosis of BSTS was made by comparison with a prior specimen 
and/or ancillary studies (molecular or immunohistochemical stains). The 
prognosis was poor because 95% of the patients died of their disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of BSTS in fluid cytology is extremely rare, and it 
can have cytologic features similar to those of non-BSTS malignancies. Although, 
in most cases, a comparison with a prior known BSTS specimen may suffice, the 
use of ancillary studies is extremely helpful in arriving at the correct 
diagnosis. However, in cases with no known prior malignancy, including BSTS in 
the differential diagnosis is prudent for preventing misdiagnosis.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) encompasses a heterogeneous group of tumors with striated 
muscle differentiation. RMSs are classified as alveolar, embryonal, spindle 
cell/sclerosing, and pleomorphic types and molecular analysis of these tumors 
has identified aberrations that are useful in their further subclassification. 
Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma (SpRMS) is uncommon and has been described with 
VGLL2 fusions, EWSR1/FUS-TFCP2 rearrangements, and myoD1 mutations-the mutations 
are associated with significantly different prognoses. In addition, the 
NCOA2-MEIS1 fusion gene was recently described in two primary intraosseous RMS 
that contained spindle cell components. Herein, we report three cases of SpRMS 
harboring different novel fusion genes, one possessing EP300-VGLL3, a second 
with NCOA2-MEIS1 and CAV1-MET, and the third case had HMGA2-NEGR1 and multiple 
amplified genes.

Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (ssRMS) is a rare subtype of 
rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) that has fascicular spindle cell and/or sclerosing 
morphology. SsRMS has a diverse molecular background and is categorized into 
three groups: congenital/infantile ssRMS with a gene fusion involving the NCOA2 
and VGLL2, ssRMS with the MYOD1 mutation, and ssRMS with no recurrent 
identifiable genetic alterations. Because ssRMS is a newly defined disease 
concept of RMS, the optimal treatment methods have not been determined. This 
results in unfavorable prognosis and consequently signals the urgent need for 
continuous research. Patient-derived cell lines are essential tools in basic and 
translational research. However, only two ssRMS cell lines with the MYOD1 
mutation have been reported to date. Thus, we established a novel ssRMS cell 
line named NCC-ssRMS2-C1 using a surgically resected tumor tissue from an adult 
ssRMS patient. NCC-ssRMS2-C1 cells retained the copy number alterations 
corresponding to the original tumor and are categorized into the group with no 
recurrent identifiable genetic alterations. NCC-ssRMS2-C1 cells demonstrated 
constant proliferation, spheroid formation, and capability for invasion in 
vitro, reflecting the malignant features of the original tumor tissue. In a drug 
screening test, ssRMS demonstrated remarkable sensitivity to romidepsin, 
trabectedin, actinomycin D, and bortezomib. Hence, we conclude that the 
NCC-ssRMS2-C1 cell line is the first ssRMS cell line which belongs to the group 
with no recurrent identifiable genetic alterations, and it will be a useful 
resource in both basic and translational studies for ssRMS.

The myogenic differentiation 1 gene (MYOD1) p.L122R somatic mutation was first 
discovered in a subset of clinically aggressive embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and 
has since been described in both pediatric and adult spindle cell/sclerosing 
rhabdomyosarcomas. Relatively little is known about the clinical, molecular, and 
histopathological features of these tumors in children. In order to further 
characterize the genomic and clinical features of pediatric MYOD1-mutant 
sarcomas, we evaluated a cohort of soft-tissue sarcoma patients treated at Texas 
Children's Hospital. Tumor DNA was subjected to next-generation panel sequencing 
and/or Sanger sequencing of the MYOD1 hotspot mutation. The MYOD1 p.L122R 
mutation was identified in six tumors, with a variant allele fraction greater 
than 0.8 in three cases, suggestive of loss of heterozygosity. One sclerosing 
rhabdomyosarcoma lacking the MYOD1 hotspot mutation was observed to have a MYOD1 
copy number gain, also with evidence of loss of heterozygosity. Cancer gene 
panel sequencing revealed potentially targetable alterations in six of seven 
(86%) patients with MYOD1 alterations, including four patients with an 
alteration in the PI3K-AKT pathway: two hotspot PIK3CA mutations and deletions 
in PTEN and TSC2. On histopathologic review, MYOD1-altered tumors exhibited 
spindle and/or round cells and varying degrees of hyaline sclerosis. At last 
follow-up, six patients had died of disease and the seventh progressed early and 
was subsequently lost to follow-up. Both pre- and post-therapy patient-derived 
xenograft models were generated from one patient's tumor. These models were 
confirmed to harbor the MYOD1 and PIK3CA mutations seen in the primary tumor and 
were shown to be sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibition in vitro and in vivo. In 
conclusion, this study adds to recent reports describing the clinicopathologic 
and genomic features of MYOD1-altered soft-tissue sarcomas in children, 
including dismal prognosis and potential molecular targets for therapy. The 
novel preclinical models developed will facilitate further biological and 
preclinical study of this rare and aggressive tumor. © 2021 The Pathological

First described in 1995 by Meis-Kindbloom et al. as a variant of fibrosarcoma 
simulating carcinoma, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a malignant 
soft tissue sarcoma characterized by epithelioid cells in dense sclerotic 
stroma, frequent immunoreactivity for MUC4 and heterogeneous genetic profile 
with recurrent EWSR1 gene rearrangement. It typically affects middle-age adults 
with a predilection for the lower extremity. It is believed that SEF is closely 
related to low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), both tumors show overlapping 
features in morphology, immunophenotype, and molecular profile. In this review, 
we discuss the clinical, morphologic, and immunohistochemical features of SEF 
with particular emphasis on its molecular diversity and relation to LGFMS.

The diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is challenging because of 
its potential overlap with other neoplasms or even with reactive conditions. DNA 
methylation analysis is effective in diagnosing tumors. In the present study, 
this approach was tested for use in MPM diagnosis. The DNA methylation patterns 
of a discovery cohort and an independent-validation cohort of MPMs were compared 
to those of 202 cases representing malignant and benign diagnostic mimics 
(angiosarcoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, 
lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, nodular fasciitis, 
reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, sclerosing fibrous pleuritis, solitary fibrous 
tumor, and synovial sarcoma). By both unsupervised hierarchical clustering and 
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis, MPM samples in the 
discovery cohort exhibited a DNA methylation profile different from those of 
other neoplastic and reactive mimics. These results were confirmed in the 
independent validation cohort and by in silico analysis of the MPM-The Cancer 
Genome Atlas data set. Copy number variation profiles were also inferred to 
identify molecular hallmarks of MPM, including CDKN2A and NF2 deletions. 
Methylation profiling was effective in the diagnosis of MPM, although caution is 
advised in samples with low tumor cell content.

Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) of the uterus has recently been shown to 
frequently harbor DICER1 mutations. Interestingly, only rare cases of 
extrauterine DICER1-associated ERMS, mostly located in the genitourinary tract, 
have been reported to date. Our goal was to study clinicopathologic and 
molecular profiles of DICER1-mutant (DICER1-mut) and DICER1-wild type 
(DICER1-wt) ERMS in a cohort of genitourinary tumors. We collected a cohort of 
17 ERMS including nine uterine (four uterine corpus and five cervix), one 
vaginal, and seven urinary tract tumors. DNA sequencing revealed mutations of 
DICER1 in 9/9 uterine ERMS. All other ERMS of our cohort were DICER1-wt. The 
median age at diagnosis of patients with DICER1-mut and DICER1-wt ERMS was 36 
years and 5 years, respectively. Limited follow-up data (available for 15/17 
patients) suggested that DICER1-mut ERMS might show a less aggressive clinical 
course than DICER1-wt ERMS. Histological features only observed in DICER1-mut 
ERMS were cartilaginous nodules (6/9 DICER1-mut ERMS), in one case accompanied 
by foci of ossification. Recurrent mutations identified in both DICER1-mut and 
DICER1-wt ERMS affected KRAS, NRAS, and TP53. Copy number analysis revealed 
similar structural variations with frequent gains on chromosomes 2, 3, and 8, 
independent of DICER1 mutation status. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 
array-based whole-genome DNA methylation data of our study cohort together with 
an extended methylation data set including different RMS subtypes from 
genitourinary and extra-genitourinary locations (n = 102), revealed a distinct 
cluster for DICER1-mut ERMS. Such tumors clearly segregated from the clusters of 
DICER1-wt ERMS, alveolar RMS, and MYOD1-mutant spindle cell and sclerosing RMS. 
Only one tumor, previously diagnosed as ERMS arising in the maxilla of a 
6-year-old boy clustered with DICER1-mut ERMS of the uterus. Subsequent 
sequencing analysis identified two DICER1 mutations in the latter case. Our 
results suggest that DICER1-mut ERMS might qualify as a distinct subtype in 
future classifications of RMS.

Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are aggressive epithelial malignancies that can 
arise at any point of the biliary tree. Albeit rare, their incidence and 
mortality rates have been rising steadily over the past 40 years, highlighting 
the need to improve current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. BTCs show 
high inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity both at the morphological and 
molecular level. Such complex heterogeneity poses a substantial obstacle to 
effective interventions. It is widely accepted that the observed heterogeneity 
may be the result of a complex interplay of different elements, including risk 
factors, distinct molecular alterations and multiple potential cells of origin. 
The use of genetic lineage tracing systems in experimental models has identified 
cholangiocytes, hepatocytes and/or progenitor-like cells as the cells of origin 
of BTCs. Genomic evidence in support of the distinct cell of origin hypotheses 
is growing. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the histopathological 
subtyping of BTCs, discuss current genomic evidence and outline lineage tracing 
studies that have contributed to the current knowledge surrounding the cell of 
origin of these tumours.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare variant of fibrosarcoma 
primarily arising in the deep soft tissue of the extremities and trunk. Despite 
having the morphologic appearance of a low-grade sarcoma, it generally has an 
aggressive clinical course with frequent local recurrences and distant 
metastases. It typically occurs in middle aged adults and is characterized by 
immunoexpression of MUC4 and recurrent gene fusions, most commonly 
EWSR1-CREB3L1. We report a primary renal SEF in a 4-year-old male. To our 
knowledge, this is the youngest patient reported with SEF and the second case of 
SEF in a pre-adolescent child. It is the eleventh reported case of primary renal 
SEF in the literature. While SEF arising in visceral organs is rare, the kidney 
is the most common primary site of any visceral organ. This case demonstrates 
SEF can occur in pre-adolescents, is an important consideration when evaluating 
sarcomas in young children, and should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis for primary renal tumors.

AIMS: To present our experience on spinal sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma 
(SEF) and review the existing literature pertaining to SEF of the spine.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Six cases of spinal SEF were reviewed, and a literature 
search of all primary SEFs of the spine was performed. All tumours occurred in 
adults (median age, 41 years) and were located all along the spine, the lumbar 
vertebrae being the most commonly involved. All patients presented with pain 
that they had experienced for months. The mean tumour size at diagnosis was 
52 mm. Five tumours showed a spectrum of microscopic features consistent with 
pure SEF, and one showed a hybrid morphology with areas of low-grade fibromyxoid 
sarcoma. All were diffusely and strongly positive for mucin 4. Two cases were 
initially misdiagnosed as epithelioid haemangioendothelioma and aggressive 
chondroblastoma. Fluorescence in-situ hybridisation showed rearrangements of 
either FUS or EWSR1 in four cases. Reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction showed the presence of FUS-CREB3L1 and EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion transcripts 
in two cases and one case, respectively. Of five patients with follow-up data 
available, two developed one or more local recurrences and three patients had 
metastatic disease. Distant metastases were mainly to other osseous locations, 
followed by lungs and lymph nodes. At last follow-up, three patients had died of 
disease and one was alive with multiple metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: SEF is an aggressive sarcoma that can involve the spine. It is 
important to recognise the spine as the primary location of SEF, in order to 
avoid misdiagnosis as more common primary spinal neoplasms, which can impact on 
therapeutic approaches.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma, 
representing approximately 40% of all pediatric soft tissue sarcomas. The 
spindle cell/sclerosing subtype of RMS (SSRMS) accounts for roughly 5% to 10% of 
all cases of adult and pediatric RMS. Historically, SSRMS were described as 
paratesticular tumors with an excellent outcome. However, more recent studies 
have identified unique molecular subgroups of SSRMS, including those with MYOD1 
mutations or VGLL2/NCOA2 fusions, which have widely disparate outcomes. The goal 
of this article is to better describe the biological heterogeneity of SSRMS, 
which may allow the pathologist to provide important prognostic information.

Primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) of bone is a rare and scarcely 
reported neoplasm. We document clinicopathological and molecular features of 9 
additional cases. Five males and 4 females had a mean age of 39 years (14-71 
years). Most tumors affected flat/irregular bones; only 3 cases involved a long 
bone. By radiology, it has characteristic radiographic features of a 
predominantly lytic expansile lesion with a sclerotic rim. Referring diagnoses 
were SEF (n = 2), low-grade osteosarcoma (n = 2), chondrosarcoma (n = 1), and 
chondromyxoid fibroma (n = 1). Histologically, five cases revealed classical 
morphology of SEF of soft tissue. Remaining cases were classified as hybrid 
SEF/low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, characterized by spindle or stellate cells, 
prominent stroma, and giant hyalinized areas. Various morphological deviations 
such as prominent vasculature (n = 3), osteoid-like material (n = 4), or 
parallel bone trabeculae (n = 2) were observed. Immunohistochemically, all cases 
showed diffuse and strong MUC4 expression. SATB2 was observed in 5/8 cases. 
Using FISH, EWSR1, and FUS rearrangements were detected in 4 cases and 1 case, 
respectively. EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion was identified in 1 additional case by 
next-generation sequencing. Recurrence and metastasis were observed in 1 case 
and 2 cases, respectively. All but one patient were alive with disease for a 
mean interval of 31 months. SEF of bone is a relatively indolent sarcoma of 
adults, most commonly located in the flat/irregular bones. Due to overlapping 
histological features, it is often misdiagnosed as osteosarcoma or a chondroid 
tumor. Most SEF of bone exhibit EWSR1 rearrangements, but rare cases may harbor 
a FUS gene fusion.

Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor of adipocytic differentiation that rarely 
arises within the mediastinum. Most of the existing data available comes from 
scattered case reports and a few small series. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) recognizes four basic types of liposarcoma: well-differentiated/atypical 
lipomatous tumor (ALT), dedifferentiated, myxoid and pleomorphic liposarcoma 
(PLS). All of these liposarcoma subtypes have been recorded to occur within the 
mediastinum. On morphologic grounds liposarcoma can present a challenge for 
diagnosis as it can be difficult to distinguish from benign adipocytic 
neoplasms, or in the case of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS), from virtually 
any other type of sarcoma. Molecularly the most common subtypes of liposarcoma 
are characterized by specific, recurrent genetic alterations involving 
amplification events of MDM2 and CDK4 in well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDL) 
and a recurrent t(12;16)(q13;p11) in myxoid liposarcoma (MLS). MDM2 and CDK4 
amplification can be assessed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ 
hybridization, or molecular techniques that evaluate copy number alterations and 
amplifications such as array based assays and next generation sequencing (NGS). 
In addition to WDL and MLS, a few additional rare subtypes of liposarcoma may 
occur in the mediastinum including PLS, myxoid WDL, thymoliposarcoma, and 
sclerosing high-grade liposarcoma. The present review will focus on the 
clinicopathologic features of the various histologic types of liposarcoma 
described in the mediastinum and their differential diagnosis. Data is derived 
from review of the largest series published in the more recent literature on 
these tumors.

Fibroblastic sarcomas of the mediastinum.

Chen S(1), Badve SS(1).

Author information:

Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

Primary mediastinal fibroblastic sarcomas constitute a rare, heterogeneous group 
of neoplasms, mainly including solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) (benign and 
malignant), low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), adult fibrosarcoma (FS), 
myxofibrosarcoma, sclerosing epithelioid FS, etc. Although morphologically 
diverse, they frequently have similar clinical and radiological features. 
Overlapping of histological features among these neoplasms can make it 
challenging for pathologists to come to an accurate diagnosis. In addition, 
other mesenchymal neoplasms and spindle cell neoplasms of the epithelial cell 
origin can occur in the mediastinum. Immunostaining and molecular testing are 
important ancillary studies to confirm or rule out primary mediastinal 
fibroblastic neoplasms. SFT and LGFMS occur more often than adult FS in the 
mediastinum and both have reliable immunostaining markers STAT6 and MUC4, 
respectively, and unique molecular changes. The incidence of adult FS has 
decreased dramatically due to recognition of morphologically and genetically 
distinctive subtypes of fibroblastic sarcoma and better understanding of 
mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal mimickers. Adult FS is extremely rare and a 
diagnosis of exclusion. Adult FS can be rendered only after careful histological 
examination and thorough ancillary studies have ruled out all its mimickers. 
This article is focused on reviewing clinicopathological features, 
immunostaining, molecular changes, prognosis and differential diagnosis of SFT, 
LGFMS, and adult FS. Correct diagnosis is crucial for oncologists to make 
appropriate clinical management plans.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare, aggressive soft-tissue 
tumor, commonly occurring in upper and lower extremities, the limb girdle, and 
the head and neck, which shows morphologic and molecular overlap with low-grade 
fibromyxoid sarcoma. For SEF in soft tissues, 100 case reports have been 
published. To our knowledge, the present case is the first to be reported in 
English literature for a primary SEF of the stomach with a rare FUS-CREM fusion. 
We report a case of gastric SEF in a 35-year-old female who presented with 
nonspecific symptoms, including night sweat, cough, and iron deficiency anemia 
for the past few months. Further workup showed, on computed tomography, a large, 
heterogeneously enhancing and centrally necrotic left upper quadrant mass, which 
measured approximately 8.4 cm. A laparoscopic partial gastrectomy with distal 
pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed. Histological examination and 
immunohistochemical staining suggested the diagnosis of primary gastric SEF, 
which was later confirmed by sarcoma fusion panel showing FUS-CREM fusion. In 
this article, we report this first case of SEF in the stomach with a rare 
FUS-CREM fusion, which has been previously reported only once in SEFs of soft 
tissue.

Sclerosing Epithelioid Fibrosarcoma: A Distinct Sarcoma With Aggressive 
Features.

Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Since its original description in 1995, the concept of sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma (SEF) as a distinctive tumor has evolved in the literature. 
Subsequent studies suggested that the presence of low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma 
(LGFMS)-like zones, occasional FUS gene rearrangements, and immunoreactivity for 
MUC4 all pointed to a close inter-relationship with LGFMS; however, more recent 
studies showed that SEF is genetically distinct from LGFMS with predominantly 
EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion and complex secondary genomic alterations. To better 
understand the relationship between these tumors, we studied 51 cases of SEF, 
the largest reported series to date, and directly compared them to a previously 
published series of LGFMS from the same institution. The male-to-female ratio 
was 1.4:1 with a median age of 45 years. Tumors occurred primarily in the lower 
extremity (12), intra-abdominal area/visceral organs (9) and chest 
wall/paraspinal region (9) with a median size of 8.2 cm. The median follow-up 
was 49 months in 45 patients: 12 developed local recurrences and 36 developed 
metastases, mainly to lung and bone. Molecular studies showed EWSR1 gene 
rearrangement in 13 cases, 3' deletion of EWSR1 in 6, monosomy for EWSR1 in 2; 
FUS gene rearrangements in 3; EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion in 7; EWSR1-CREB3L2 fusion in 
1; and YAP1-KMT2A fusion in 2. Overall survival of SEF was significantly less 
compared with LGFMS (P≤0.0001). These results indicate that SEF is a distinct 
sarcoma that behaves more aggressively than LGFMS with a shorter survival, 
higher metastatic rate, and greater propensity to involve deep soft tissue and 
bone.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal tumour with skeletal muscle 
differentiation. Its sclerosing variant is a rare entity, which is described in 
the latest WHO edition of soft tissues in association with the spindle cell 
subtype, with which it shares clinical, morphological and cytogenetic features. 
Cytogenetic advances have allowed a prognostic approach to fusiform/sclerosing 
cell rhabdomyosarcoma by individualizing 3 different genomic prognostic groups. 
The parotid location of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma is exceptional with only two 
reported cases in the literature. It can pose a diagnostic challenge because of 
its rarity and histological similarities with other malignancies. We report the 
third case of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma of the parotid gland, which occurred 
in a 7-year old girl, who had consulted for a painless swelling of the parotid 
region of 4 months duration. Gross examination of the partial parotidectomy 
demonstrated an ill-circumscribed 35×30mm, firm and white glistening tumor. 
Histologically, it was composed of cords and trabeculae of small round cells, 
with ovoid and often irregular nuclei. Mitoses were numerous. The cytoplasm was 
scanty and cell margins were unclear. Tumor cells were set in a prominent 
hyalinized matrix. Scattered rhabdomyoblastic-like tumor cells were noted. The 
diagnosis of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma was performed after the positive 
immunostaining with desmin, myogenin and smooth muscle actin. No cytogenetic or 
molecular studies were performed. The patient underwent adjuvant chemo and

INTRODUCTION: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an uncommon malignant 
fibroblastic neoplasm. The diagnosis is typically made on core needle biopsy or 
resection specimens. Cytomorphologic characterization of SEF has been limited to 
rare case reports in the literature. The goal of this study was to review a 
series of cases of SEF and to determine the feasibility of cytologic diagnosis 
of this rare tumor.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight SEF cases from 2009 to 2019 were identified in a 
retrospective review of 3 participating institutions. Cytomorphologic and 
corresponding histologic, immunophenotypic, molecular, and clinical data were 
examined and described.
RESULTS: Patients were of median age 41 years old at diagnosis with a median 
follow-up of 35.5 months. These tumors, with a median greatest dimension of 13.4 
cm, were located in the lower extremities, abdomen, retroperitoneum, head, 
groin, sacrum, and lung. The tumor cells ranged from small round, medium-sized 
ovoid/short spindle, to epithelioid/plasmacytoid cells. A sclerotic, fibrous to 
myxoid stroma was seen. Most samples revealed low-grade cytology. Two cases 
showed tumor necrosis. Only 3 cases with cell block/positive MUC4 immunostain 
were diagnostic. Corresponding molecular testing for EWSR1 gene rearrangement 
and/or EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion were positive in 5 of 8 cases on biopsy or surgical 
samples. An additional case was positive for FUS-CREB3L2 fusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of SEF based solely upon cytologic features remains 
challenging. Epithelioid or plasmacytoid morphology mimics common malignancies. 
A supportive clinical history, MUC4 immunohistochemistry, and characteristic 
molecular result should be used to aid the diagnosis.

The molecular findings in Ewing sarcoma have greatly expanded in recent years. 
Furthermore, this is particularly true for the subset termed "Ewing-like" 
undifferentiated round cell sarcomas in which new translocations have been 
reported since the fourth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours of Soft 
Tissue and Bone. Amid this expanding genetic landscape, we report a case of 
extraskeletal undifferentiated round cell "Ewing-like" sarcoma in a 27-year-old 
female. The patient presented with a large lung mass accompanied on staging 
imaging by deposits suspicious for metastatic disease in the humerus, calvarium, 
and lymph nodes of the neck and chest. Biopsy of the lung mass revealed a 
densely packed monotonous proliferation of round, uniform neoplastic cells with 
scant cytoplasm. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were diffusely 
positive for CD99, synaptophysin, TLE1, EMA, and MUC4 and negative for FLI1, 
PAX7, AE1/3, S100, SOX10, WT1, p63, desmin, and HMB45. Fluorescence in situ 
hybridization demonstrated rearrangement of the EWSR1 gene. Next-generation 
sequencing based assay revealed an EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. Taken together, the 
histomorphologic and molecular findings were considered consistent with an 
undifferentiated round cell sarcoma with an EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. Although 
described in entities such as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, low-grade 
fibromyxoid sarcoma, and small cell osteosarcoma, this has not been previously 
described in undifferentiated round cell ("Ewing-like") sarcoma. This finding 
adds to the growing list of undifferentiated round cell sarcomas with Ewing-like 
morphologic phenotype-associated fusion genes and may contribute to further 
defining and characterizing the different subset of tumors in the Ewing family 
of tumors.

Sarcomas are driven by diverse pathogenic mechanisms, including gene 
rearrangements in a subset of cases. Rare soft tissue sarcomas containing KMT2A 
fusions have recently been reported, characterized by a predilection for young 
adults, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like morphology, and an often 
aggressive course. Nonetheless, clinicopathologic and molecular descriptions of 
KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas remain limited. In this study, we identified by 
targeted next-generation RNA sequencing an index patient with KMT2A 
fusion-positive soft tissue sarcoma. In addition, we systematically searched for 
KMT2A structural variants in a comprehensive genomic profiling database of 
14,680 sarcomas interrogated by targeted next-generation DNA and/or RNA 
sequencing. We characterized the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 
KMT2A fusion-positive sarcomas, including KMT2A breakpoints, rearrangement 
partners, and concurrent genetic alterations. Collectively, we identified a 
cohort of 34 sarcomas with KMT2A fusions (0.2%), and YAP1 was the predominant 
partner (n = 16 [47%]). Notably, a complex rearrangement with YAP1 consistent 
with YAP1-KMT2A-YAP1 fusion was detected in most cases, with preservation of 
KMT2A CxxC-binding domain in the YAP1-KMT2A-YAP1 fusion and concurrent deletions 
of corresponding exons in KMT2A. The tumors often affected younger adults (age 
20-66 [median 40] years) and histologically showed variably monomorphic 
epithelioid-to-spindle shaped cells embedded in a dense collagenous stroma. 
Ultrastructural evidence of fibroblastic differentiation was noted in one tumor 
examined. Our cohort also included two sarcomas with VIM-KMT2A fusions, each 
harboring concurrent mutations in CTNNB1, SMARCB1, and ARID1A and characterized 
histologically by sheets of spindle-to-round blue cells. The remaining 16 
KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas in our cohort exhibited diverse histologic subtypes, 
each with unique novel fusion partners. In summary, KMT2A-fusion-positive 
sarcomas most commonly exhibit sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like 
morphology and complex YAP1-KMT2A-YAP1 fusions. Cases also include rare 
spindle-to-round cell sarcomas with VIM-KMT2A fusions and tumors of diverse 
histologic subtypes with unique KMT2A fusions to non-YAP1 non-VIM partners.

Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic neoplasms of the head and neck encompass a 
group of rare tumor types with often overlapping clinicopathologic features that 
range in biologic potential from benign to overtly malignant. Even neoplasms 
with no metastatic potential may provide significant therapeutic challenges in 
this region due to the unique anatomy of the head and neck. This review will 
cover the following entities, highlighting important clinical aspects of each 
neoplasm and then focusing on their characteristic histomorphology, 
immunophenotype, and molecular alterations: nodular and cranial fasciitis, 
fibrous hamartoma of infancy, nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, nuchal-type and 
Gardner fibromas, desmoid fibromatosis, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and 
giant cell fibroblastoma, solitary fibrous tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic 
tumor, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma, low-grade 
fibromyxoid sarcoma, and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. While some of 
these neoplasms characteristically arise in the head and neck, others are rarely 
described in this anatomic region and may therefore be particularly difficult to 
recognize. Distinction between these entities, however, is crucial, particularly 
as the molecular pathogenetic basis for these neoplasms are being rapidly 
elucidated, in some instances allowing for targeted therapeutic approaches.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma. 
In the majority of cases, there is overexpression of MUC4, and most cases show 
EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusions. A subset of SEF displays composite histologic 
features of SEF and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). These "hybrid" tumors 
are more likely to harbor the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion, which is also seen in most 
LGFMS. We, here, characterize a series of 8 soft tissue neoplasms with 
morphologic features highly overlapping with LGFMS and SEF but lacking MUC4 
expression and EWSR1/FUS-CREB3L gene fusions. Seven tumors showed fusions of the 
YAP1 and KMT2A genes, and 1 had a fusion of PRRX1 and KMT2D; all but 1 case 
displayed reciprocal gene fusions. At gene expression profiling, YAP1 and 
KMT2A/PRRX1 and KMT2D tumors were distinct from LGFMS/SEF. The patients were 4 
female individuals and 4 male individuals aged 11 to 91 years. Tumors with known 
locations were in the lower extremity (5), trunk (2), and upper extremity (1); 3 
originated in acral locations. Tumor size ranged from 2.5 to 13 cm. Proportions 
of SEF-like and LGFMS-like areas varied considerably among tumors. All tumors 
that showed infiltrative growth and mitotic figures per 10 HPFs ranged from 0 to 
18. Tumor necrosis was present in 1 case. Follow-up was available for 5 patients 
(11 to 321 mo), 2 of whom developed local recurrences, and 1 died of metastatic 
disease. The clinical behavior of these soft tissue sarcomas remains to be 
further delineated in larger series with extended follow-up; however, our 
limited clinical data indicate that they are potentially aggressive.

A solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare neoplasm with recurrent NAB2-STAT6 gene 
fusion. An SFT may develop almost anywhere throughout the body, including the 
head and neck region, and is characterized by a broad spectrum of malignancy. 
Here we present a case involving a 57-year-old male with a dumbbell-shaped SFT 
in the cervical spine that mimicked schwannoma. Repeated fine-needle aspiration 
cytology failed to establish a definitive diagnosis. Given that the tumor size 
increased significantly over a 10-month period, open biopsy was then performed. 
Though the biopsy result was inconclusive, a nonepithelial tumor, including 
sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma or ossifying fibromyxoid tumor, was 
suspected. The tumor was then completely removed together with adjacent parts of 
C2 and C3 vertebrae and left vertebral artery via combined anterior and 
posterior approaches. Histologically, the tumor consisted of round cells with 
prominent stromal hyalinization and was immunohistochemically positive for 
STAT6, CD34, and cytokeratin. Finally, Todai OncoPanel, a next-generation 
sequencing-based molecular profiling system using formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded samples, demonstrated fusion transcript in which NAB2 exon 6 
was fused to STAT6 exon 16 supporting the diagnosis of SFT, while whole-exome 
sequencing analysis detected no somatic mutations which were known to be 
oncogenic.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare sarcoma subtype 
characterized by monomorphic epithelioid cells embedded in a densely sclerotic 
collagenous matrix. The overwhelming majority of tumors arise in soft tissues; 
however, rare cases have been documented to occur primarily in bone. The 
hallmarks of soft tissue SEF include MUC4 immunoreactivity and the presence of 
an EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. Rare cases with alternative fusions have also been 
reported such as EWSR1-CREB3L2 and FUS-CREB3L2 transcripts. The molecular 
alterations of skeletal SEF have not been well-defined, with only rare cases 
analyzed to date. In this study we investigated the clinicopathologic and 
molecular features of seven patients presenting with primary osseous SEF. There 
were 3 males and 4 females, with a mean age at diagnosis of 38 years. All cases 
had microscopic features within the histologic spectrum of SEF and showed strong 
and diffuse MUC4 positivity, while lacking SATB2 expression. However, due to its 
unusual presentation within bone, four cases were initially misinterpreted as 
either osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma or chondroblastoma. Half of the patients with 
follow-up data developed metastasis. The cases were tested by targeted RNA 
sequencing, MSK-IMPACT, and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization, showing 
EWSR1-CREB3L1 in six cases and EWSR1-CREB3L2 in one case. The fusion transcripts 
were composed of EWSR1 exon 11 to either exon 6 of CREB3L1 or CREB3L2. In 
summary, due to their rarity in the bone, skeletal SEF are often misdiagnosed, 
resulting in inadequate treatment modalities. Similar to their soft tissue 
counterpart, bone SEF follow an aggressive clinical behavior and show similar 
EWSR1-CREB3L1/CREB3L2 fusions.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma, 
characterized by a distinctive epithelioid phenotype in a densely sclerotic 
collagenous stroma, that shows frequent MUC4 immunoreactivity and recurrent gene 
fusions, often involving EWSR1 gene. A pathogenetic link with low-grade 
fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) has been suggested, due to cases with hybrid 
morphology as well as overlapping genetic signature. However, a small subset of 
SEF is negative for MUC4 and lacks the canonical EWSR1/FUS gene rearrangements. 
Triggered by the identification of recurrent YAP1-KMT2A gene fusions by RNA 
sequencing in 3 index cases of MUC4-negative, EWSR1/FUS fusion-negative SEF, we 
further investigated a cohort of 14 similar SEF cases (MUC4-negative, EWSR1/FUS 
fusion-negative) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and/or DNA-based massively parallel 
sequencing (MSK-IMPACT) for abnormalities in these genes. Three additional SEFs 
with KMT2A gene rearrangements and one additional case with YAP1 gene 
rearrangements were identified by FISH. In addition, one case with YAP1-KMT2A 
and one with KMT2A-YAP1 fusion were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction and MSK-IMPACT, respectively. As a control group, 24 fibromyxoid 
spindle cell tumors, diagnosed or suspected as fusion-negative LGFMS, were also 
tested for YAP1 and KMT2A abnormalities by FISH, but none were positive. The 
YAP1/KMT2A-rearranged SEF group affected patients ranging from 10 to 86 years 
old (average and median: 45) of both sexes (4 females, 5 males). The tumors 
involved somatic soft tissues with a wide distribution, including extremities, 
trunk, neck, and dura. Histologically, the tumors showed variable cellularity, 
with monotonous ovoid to epithelioid tumor cells and hyalinized collagenous 
background typical of SEF. More than half of the cases showed infiltrative 
borders, within fat or skeletal muscle. No LGFMS component was identified. All 
tumors were negative for MUC4 and had an otherwise nonspecific immunophenotype. 
Of the 6 cases with available follow-up information, 2 had local recurrences, 
and 2 developed soft tissue and/or bone metastases, including 1 of them died of 
the disease.

uterus. We present a case of a 38 years-old woman, whose benign looking uterine 
mass was primary diagnosed as a sclerosing leiomyoma. However, the tumor 
relapsed in two years with multisite metastases in the abdomen. The complex 
differential diagnosis excluded the most common mesenchymal tumors of the 
gynecological tract. Finally, we diagnosed the tumor as an epithelioid 
sclerosing fibrosarcoma arising from the uterine.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an uncommon neoplasm that rarely 
presents in bone. It is characterized by epithelioid cells arranged in nests and 
single-file cords within a sclerotic stromal background which may mimic 
neoplastic bone. SEF harbors an EWSR1 translocation, which may complicate its 
distinction from Ewing sarcoma in cases with histomorphologic overlap. We 
present a diagnostically challenging case of SEF in the mandible of a 
16-year-old girl. Our experience highlights the lack of specificity of 
traditional morphology and EWSR1 break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization. 
Open-ended RNA-based fusion gene testing coupled with MUC4 immunohistochemistry 
aided the eventual diagnosis in this case. Herein, we report the third case of 
SEF with EWSR1-CREB3L3 translocation and show that this fusion leads to aberrant 
upregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin 
signaling pathway in heterologous cell models.

ATF1, CREB1, and CREM constitute the CREB family of transcription factors. The 
genes encoding these factors are involved in gene fusion events in human tumors. 
EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB1 are the 2 most characterized fusions, whereas 
EWSR1-CREM has been less studied. To better understand the phenotypic spectrum 
of mesenchymal tumors associated with the EWSR1-CREM fusion, we investigated 
archival cases using fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or RNA sequencing. 
Among 33 clear cell sarcomas of soft tissue tested, we found 1 specimen, a hand 
tumor bearing the rearrangements of EWSR1 and CREM, with classic histology and 
immunophenotype. None of 6 clear cell sarcoma-like tumors of the 
gastrointestinal tract tested harbored the EWSR1-CREM fusion. Among 11 
angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas, we found that 3 tumors of myxoid variant 
harbored the rearrangements of EWSR1 and CREM. All 3 tumors occurred in 
middle-aged men and involved the distal extremities (N=2) and the lung (N=1). 
Prominent lymphoid cuff, fibrous pseudocapsule, and amianthoid fiber were 
present in 3, 2, and 2 tumors, respectively, whereas none showed 
pseudoangiomatoid spaces. All 3 tumors were immunohistochemically positive for 
epithelial membrane antigen and desmin. These cases suggested a closer 
relationship between angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma and a recently proposed 
novel group of myxoid tumors with CREB family fusions. Our cohort also included 
2 unclassifiable sarcomas positive for EWSR1-CREM. One of these was an 
aggressive pediatric tumor of the abdominal cavity characterized by 
proliferation of swirling spindle cells immunopositive for cytokeratin and CD34. 
The other tumor derived from the chest wall of an adult and exhibited a 
MUC4-positive sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like histology. Our study 
demonstrates that a wider phenotypic spectrum is associated with the EWSR1-CREM 
fusion than previously reported.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDL) are often 
partly composed of sclerotic tissue, however, the amount varies widely between 
tumors, and its prognostic significance is unknown. We hypothesized that tumors 
with more sclerosis would behave more aggressively.
METHODS: Primary retroperitoneal WDL from 29 patients resected at our 
institution with follow-up were histologically evaluated by soft tissue 
pathologists blinded to outcome. Tumors with ≥ 10% sclerosis were designated 
"sclerotic" while tumors with < 10% sclerosis were designated as "minimally 
sclerotic". Cellular and dedifferentiated tumors were excluded. Clinical 
parameters and radiologic assessments on computed tomography (CT) were recorded.
RESULTS: Histological evaluation identified 13 minimally sclerotic WDL and 16 
sclerotic WDL. Median follow-up was 9 years (range, 3-20). Median 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) and median overall survival (OS) were 6.16 and 
13.9 years, respectively. Compared with patients with sclerotic WDL, those with 
minimally sclerotic WDL had superior RFS (HR = 0.17 [95% CI, 0.06-0.53], 
P = .002) and OS (log-rank test, P = .002). Sclerotic WDL exhibited higher 
Houndsfield Units than minimally sclerotic WDL (26 vs 1, P = .040).
CONCLUSIONS: Minimally sclerotic WDL were associated with more favorable outcome 
compared with sclerotic tumors. Assessment of sclerosis in WDL is likely a 
useful prognostic marker.

We present two cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) that arose 
primarily in the kidney. The tumor in both cases was located at the upper pole 
of the kidney. Clincially, they were suspected as renal cell carcinomas. 
However, histological examination revealed densely hyalinized epithelioid tumor 
suggestive of SEF. The diffuse immunohistochemical staining of MUC4 by 
neoplastic cells and the presence of EWSR1 gene rearrangement by subsequent 
florescence in site hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed the histological 
diagnosis. Molecular cytogenetic study is highly helpful in arriving at a final 
diagnosis, in particular to a rare tumor type that arises at an unusual site.

AIMS: Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcomas (SC/SRMS) feature spindled 
and/or rounded rhabdomyosarcomatous cells within variably hyalinised stroma. 
Only 30-67% of SC/SRMSs harbour neomorphic MYOD1 p.L122R mutations, indicating 
heterogeneity in this RMS type. We compared MYOD1-mutant and non-mutant cases to 
characterise the histological and genetic spectrum of mutated SC/SRMS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen RMSs with spindled, sclerosing or hybrid 
histology were sequenced to identify MYOD1 and PIK3CA mutations and reappraised 
to assess histological features and myogenic immunophenotypes. Twelve SC/SRMSs 
harboured MYOD1 mutations, including homozygous p.L122R (n = 8), heterozygous 
p.L122R (n = 3) and heterozygous p.E118K (n = 1). MYOD1-mutant tumours affected 
nine females and three males aged 8-64 years (median = 22.5), had a median size 
of 4.2 cm (range = 2-22) and involved the head and neck (n = 7), extremities 
(n = 4) and mediastinum (n = 1). Fascicular/spindle histology was predominant in 
four cases, including one with heterologous lipoblasts in focally myxoid stroma. 
Four sclerosing cases mainly comprised rounded cells, including one with 
multinucleated tumour cells. Four cases were histologically hybrid. The only 
PIK3CA (p.H1047R) mutation was detected in a predominantly spindled 
MYOD1-p.L122R-mutated case, but not in its laser-microdissected 
lipoblast-containing area. All MYOD1-mutant cases exhibited diffuse MYOD1 
expression but patchy myogenin reactivity. At final follow-up 
(median = 13.5 months), recurrences (n = 4), metastases (n = 2) or both (n = 1) 
occurred in seven MYOD1-mutant cases; one had died of disease. Five non-mutated 
cases were reclassified as spindle embryonal (n = 3), dense embryonal (n = 1) 
and unclassifiable (n = 1) RMSs.
CONCLUSION: MYOD1-mutant RMSs are uncommonly mutated with PIK3CA and behave 
aggressively with an expanded morphological and genetic spectrum, including 
lipoblastic differentiation, multinucleated cells and the alternative p.E118K 
mutation.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma of the extremities: a clinicopathologic study of 
24 cases and review of the literature.

Sambri A, Righi A, Tuzzato G, Donati D, Bianchi G.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) and hybrid sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma (SEF)/LGFMS have a low potential for recurrence (10%) and 
metastasis (5%) but they are notorious for late occurring metastases. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the outcome of LGFMS and review similar cases 
reported in the literature. We retrospectively evaluated 24 LGFMS operated at a 
single Institution. All cases were histologically revised. Mean age was 34 years 
(range, 8 to 74). Two cases presented areas of SEF (hybrid tumours). Three 
patients presented with metastasis at diagnosis. A strong cytoplasmic staining 
for MUC4 antibody was found in the majority of neoplastic cells. RT-PCR was 
feasible in 6 cases and it detected the presence of FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene 
chimeric transcript. Mean follow-up was 44 months (range, 6 to 217). Two 
patients developed lung metastasis after 9 and 26 months respectively. Low-grade 
fibromyxoid sarcoma has a various histopathologic spectrum with few cases of 
LGFMS that share histopathologic resemblance with SEF, thereby reinforcing a 
possibility of a link within these two. It is of paramount importance an 
accurate and extensive sampling and examination of the whole specimen, in order 
to identify higher risk patients.

BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a round cell sarcoma that can be challenging 
to diagnose on cytologic material given its significant overlap with numerous 
mesenchymal, epithelial, and lymphoid cytomorphologic mimics. The objective of 
this study was to assess the utility of a novel marker, NKX2.2, in the diagnosis 
of ES in cytologic material and its ability to distinguish ES from its mimics.
METHODS: NKX2.2 immunohistochemistry was performed on cell blocks from 107 
fine-needle aspirations, and nuclear expression was scored semiquantitatively 
for extent and intensity. The study cohort included ES (n = 10), well 
differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (n = 20), melanoma (n = 11), Merkel cell 
carcinoma (n = 10), small cell carcinoma (n = 10), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (n 
= 2), spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), synovial sarcoma (n = 
12), solitary fibrous tumor (n = 2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 10), 
lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 11), adenoid cystic carcinoma (n = 6), and 
CIC-rearranged sarcoma (n = 1).
RESULTS: NKX2.2 had high sensitivity (100%) and moderate specificity (85%) for 
the diagnosis of ES in cytologic material. NKX2.2 expression also was present in 
a subset of mesenchymal and epithelial mimics, and staining was most commonly 
observed in small cell carcinoma (80%) and well differentiated neuroendocrine 
tumor (45%). Among mesenchymal mimics, 42% exhibited NKX2.2 expression. NKX2.2 
staining was absent in melanoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and 
lymphoproliferative neoplasms.
CONCLUSIONS: NKX2.2 is a highly sensitive but only moderately specific marker 
for ES. Neuroendocrine neoplasms exhibit variable NKX2.2 expression and remain a 
significant potential diagnostic pitfall. Thus, NKX2.2 expression should be 
interpreted in the context of an appropriate immunohistochemical panel (and 
often with confirmatory molecular testing) for the accurate diagnosis of ES.

BACKGROUND: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a very rare soft tissue 
sarcoma subtype. Clinically it is an aggressive tumour; however, to our 
knowledge there are no published reports regarding the efficacy of chemotherapy 
in SEF. Therefore, the aim of this study was to document the outcome of a series 
of patients with SEF treated at a single referral centre with reference to 
systemic therapy.
METHODS: A retrospective search of a prospectively maintained database was 
performed to identify all patients diagnosed with SEF between 1990 and 2017. The 
diagnosis was confirmed in each case by a dedicated soft tissue sarcoma 
pathologist. We analysed those with recurrent disease and the effect of systemic 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients were identified, median overall survival from 
diagnosis and metastasis were 47.3 (95% CI 25.0-131.9) and 16.3 (95% CI 
5.3-20.6) months, respectively. In total, 12 (92.3%) patients developed 
metastatic disease of which 10 died of disease, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 
had recently commenced palliative treatment. Among the 10 patients with 
metastatic disease, 7 received palliative chemotherapy. Palliative chemotherapy 
resulted in partial response in 1 patient, stable disease in 3 patients and 
progressive disease in 3 patients. Median time to disease progression was 2.7 
(95% CI 1.2-4.4) months. Two of 13 patients were treated with adjuvant 
chemotherapy, receiving 6 cycles of liposomal doxorubicin and 1 cycle of 
doxorubicin, respectively, with a metastasis-free survival of 28.2 and 
7.1 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: SEF is an aggressive sarcoma subtype with a poor outcome and with 
limited responsiveness to conventional chemotherapy. Patients with this subtype 
should be considered for participation in clinical trials with novel agents. 
Further investigation into the biology of this rare disease is required to 
improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Despite extensive immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular studies 
combined with morphologic findings, a group of round/ovoid cell tumors 
histologically similar to Ewing sarcomas (ES) but lacking EWSR1-rearrangements 
may remain unclassifiable.
DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed 41 Ewing-like tumors (formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded) previously determined as negative or non-informative for 
EWSR1-rearrangements by FISH and/or RT-PCR. A new histopathology revision and 
additional IHC and molecular analyses were carried out in order to investigate 
whether additional IHC and/or molecular testing in combination with the 
morphological findings may help in reaching a definitive diagnosis.
RESULTS: Almost all the tumors (n=40) involved soft tissue and/or bone and half 
the patients died of disease. In the archival cases all diagnoses were Ewing 
sarcoma (ES), Ewing-like sarcoma (ELS), myoepithelial tumor and undifferentiated 
sarcoma (US). In the new review all the tumors were re-classified as, ES (n=16), 
Ewing-like tumor with EWSR1 rearrangement and amplification and possible 
EWSR1-NFATC2 gene fusion (n=1), CIC-rearranged sarcomas or undifferentiated 
sarcoma, most consistent with CIC-rearranged sarcoma (n=7), sarcoma with 
BCOR-alteration or undifferentiated sarcoma, consistent with BCOR-associated 
sarcoma (n=3), neuroblastoma (n=2), unclassifiable neoplasm with neuroblastic 
differentiation (n=1), malignant rhabdoid tumor (n=2), lymphoblastic lymphoma 
(n=1), clear cell sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract (n=1), small cell 
carcinoma (n=1), sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1), desmoplastic small round 
cell tumor (n=1), malignant peripheral sheath nerve tumor (n=1), 
poorly-differentiated synovial sarcoma (n=1), Possible gastrointestinal stromal 
tumor/GIST with predominant round cells (n=1) and possible 
SMARCA4-deficient-sarcoma (n=1). NKX2.2, ETV4 and BCOR immunoreactivity was 
observed in all ES, CIC-rearranged sarcomas and sarcomas with BCOR alteration, 
respectively. CIC-rearrangement by FISH was observed in many of the 
CIC-rearranged sarcomas.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis of 41 Ewing-like tumors confirms that there may be a 
significant pathological and IHC overlap among Ewing-like tumors, with 
prognostic and therapeutic impacts. Additional IHC (NKX2.2, ETV4 and BCOR) and 
molecular studies including FUS, CIC or BCOR analysis may support the final 
diagnosis when FISH or RT-PCR fail to detect EWSR1-rearrangements. Any molecular 
findings should always be interpreted in relation to the specific clinical and 
pathological context.

(SEF) are rare tumors with distinct sets of morphological features, both 
characterized by MUC4 immunoreactivity. Tumors exhibiting features of both 
entities are considered hybrid LGFMS-SEF lesions. While the majority of LGFMS 
cases are characterized by FUS-CREB3L2 gene fusions, most cases of pure SEF show 
EWSR1 gene rearrangements. In the largest study of hybrid LGFMS-SEF tumors to 
date, all cases exhibited FUS rearrangements, a similar genetic profile to 
LGFMS. We herein describe the clinicopathological features and genetic findings 
of a case of primary renal hybrid LGFMS-SEF occurring in a 10-year-old child, 
with disseminated metastases. Fusion gene detection using a next-generation 
sequencing-based anchored multiplex PCR technique (Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma 
Panel) was performed on both the primary renal tumor that showed the morphology 
of a LGFMS, and a cervical metastasis that showed the morphology of SEF. An 
EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusion occurring between exon 11 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of 
CREB3L1 was present in both the LGFMS and SEF components. This unusual case 
provides evidence that a subset of hybrid LGFMS-SEF harbor EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene 
fusions. In this case, these features were associated with an aggressive 
clinical course, with disease-associated mortality occurring within 12 months of 
diagnosis.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an uncommon variant of fibrosarcoma 
that is characterized by a distinct morphology. It most frequently presents in 
the deep soft tissues of the lower extremities, often in intimate association 
with fascia and periosteum, although reports of the head and neck involvement 
have been reported. A minority of cases show morphological, immunohistochemical 
and molecular overlap with low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LG-FMS). Herein, we 
describe a case of a bland spindle cell neoplasm presenting in the jaw that was 
initially incompletely excised. Over the course of 20 years the tumor 
subsequently recurred with a SEF morphology. Molecular testing performed on both 
specimens subsequently confirmed the presence of an EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusion. 
This report highlights the diagnostic difficulty with LG-FMS, particularly in 
unusual anatomic locations; reiterates the potential for the uncommon 
EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion product in LG-FMS; and, reaffirms the potential for 
progression and/or overlap between LG-FMS to SEF over time.

We report the case of a sclerosing perineurioma with conspicious collagen 
rosette formation in a 20-year-old male presenting with a firm, painless nodule 
on the palmar side of his right ring finger. The main differential diagnosis is 
a low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. The distinction between these entities is 
important because low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma has a metastatic potential, 
while, as a rule, perineuriomas are benign. The presence of collagen rosettes in 
this current case makes this distinction even more difficult given that 
approximately 30% of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma cases show the focal presence 
of collagen rosettes. The demonstration of the characteristic t(7;16), t(11;16) 
or t(11;22) translocations (resulting in the FUS-CREB3L2, FUS-CREB3L1 or 
EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion genes, respectively) or immunoreactivity for MUC4, a 
recently described sensitive and specific marker for low-grade fibromyxoid 
sarcoma, remain the gold standard in the diagnosis of low-grade fibromyxoid 
sarcoma, differentiating it from perineurioma. This case is, to our knowledge, 
the first report on collagen rosettes in sclerosing perineurioma, extremely well 
mimicking low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, and further expanding the morphological 
spectrum of this rare subtype of perineurioma.

Purpose: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a highly aggressive soft 
tissue sarcoma closely related to low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). Some 
tumors display morphologic characteristics of both SEF and LGFMS, hence they are 
known as hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Despite the overlap of gene fusion variants between 
these two tumor types, SEF is much more aggressive. The current study aimed to 
further characterize SEF and hybrid SEF/LGFMS genetically to better understand 
the role of the characteristic fusion genes and possible additional genetic 
alterations in tumorigenesis.Experimental Design: We performed whole-exome 
sequencing, SNP array analysis, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), global gene expression 
analyses, and/or IHC on a series of 13 SEFs and 6 hybrid SEF/LGFMS. We also 
expressed the FUS-CREB3L2 and EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion genes conditionally in a 
fibroblast cell line; these cells were subsequently analyzed by RNA-seq, and 
expression of the CD24 protein was assessed by FACS analysis.Results: The SNP 
array analysis detected a large number of structural aberrations in SEF and 
SEF/LGFMS, many of which were recurrent, notably DMD microdeletions. RNA-seq 
identified FUS-CREM and PAX5-CREB3L1 as alternative fusion genes in one SEF 
each. CD24 was strongly upregulated, presumably a direct target of the fusion 
proteins. This was further confirmed by the gene expression analysis and FACS 
analysis on Tet-On 3G cells expressing EWSR1-CREB3L1Conclusions: Although gene 
fusions are the primary tumorigenic events in both SEF and LGFMS, additional 
genomic changes explain the differences in aggressiveness and clinical outcome 
between the two types. CD24 and DMD constitute potential therapeutic targets.

Atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT)/well-differentiated liposarcoma 
(WDL)/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) is a common type of liposarcoma in late 
adulthood. However, pediatric ALT/WDL/DDL is extremely rare, and only 3 cases 
have been described in children younger than 10 years of age. Notably, none of 
these cases harbored MDM2 gene amplification. Here, we reported a sclerosing 
ALT/WDL in a 7-year-old Chinese girl. Histologically, in most areas, the 
neoplastic cells were embedded within the collagenous background, and typical 
lipogenic areas were inconspicuous throughout the sclerotic areas. In addition, 
scattered small foci of atypical osseous/chondrous elements were identified. 
Notably, a small typical lipoma-like ALT/WDL area was detected in the periphery 
of the mass. Immunohistochemically, all the neoplastic components demonstrated 
positivity for MDM2, CDK4, and p16. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed 
MDM2 gene amplification in all the tumor components. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first example of MDM2-amplified ALT/WDL in this age 
group.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is a bland spindle cell neoplasm that 
typically arises in the deep soft tissues of the proximal extremities or trunk 
of young adults. The majority of LGFMS are characterized by a recurrent 
(7;16)(q34;p11) translocation, resulting in the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene, which 
generates a chimeric protein with transcriptional regulatory activity. Small 
numbers harbor a FUS-CREB3L1 fusion resulting from t(11;16)(p11;p11), whilst 
rare cases harbor the EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. LGFMS is of low to moderate 
cellularity and consists of bland spindle cells with small, angulated nuclei and 
scant, wispy cytoplasm, arranged in a whorled growth pattern and typically 
showing abrupt transition from myxoid to fibrous areas. Immunohistochemical 
expression of MUC4 is a consistent finding. Hyalinized spindle cell tumor with 
giant rosettes (HSCTGR) is a morphological variant of LGFMS that shares the same 
balanced translocation, and is also immunoreactive for MUC4. A potential 
relationship between LGFMS and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF), a rare 
fibroblastic neoplasm that most commonly arises in the deep soft tissues of the 
lower extremities, limb girdles or trunk, has also been suggested. SEF is 
classically composed of nests and cords of epithelioid cells with clear or 
eosinophilic cytoplasm embedded within densely sclerotic stroma. In some cases, 
areas indistinguishable from LGFMS are present, and these have been shown to 
contain FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts. The majority of pure SEF tumors harbor 
EWSR1 rearrangements, with EWSR1-CREB3L1 and more rarely EWSR1-CREB3L2 gene 
fusions more common than those involving FUS. MUC4 immunoreactivity is also seen 
in approximately 70% of SEF. Surgical resection of these tumors with clear 
margins is the treatment of choice. Correct diagnosis is important because of 
the significant potential for recurrence and late metastatic spread. We review 
LGFMS and SEF, discussing morphology and immunohistochemistry, genetics and 
molecular findings, and the differential diagnosis.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare, malignant fibroblastic 
neoplasm, morphologically composed of cords, nests or sheets of monotonous 
epithelioid cells within a collagenous matrix. It has been recently 
characterized by recurrent pathogenic EWS-CREB3L1/2 or FUS-CREB3L2 fusions and 
common MUC4 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Typically SEF occur in 
middle-aged adults and rarely have been reported within the abdominal cavity. 
Here we report an 18-year-old man with intraabdominal tumor and multiple 
disseminated liver metastases, presenting pure SEF histologic and 
immunophenotypic features. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed 
unbalanced rearrangement of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) gene. 
Genomic profiling by array CGH, followed by RT-PCR and sequencing analysis, 
revealed a previously not reported EWSR1 translocation partner, cAMP-responsive 
element-binding protein 3-like 3 (CREB3L3). The novel EWSR1-CREB3L3 fusion 
further extends the range of fusion types involving EWSR1 that are 
characteristic for SEF.

We report the case of a 55-year-old woman who developed a mass in the soft 
tissue of the anterior right proximal thigh. Microscopic findings in the biopsy 
specimen supported the diagnosis of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF). 
This entity is part of a spectrum of lesions that includes low-grade fibromyxoid 
sarcoma (LGFMS) and hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes (HSCTGR). 
It shares with LGFMS occasional overlapping histopathologic features and 
immunopositivity for MUC4. Although FUS and CREB3L2 gene rearrangements, 
characteristics of LGFMS, have been found in hybrid tumors (those with features 
of both SEF and LGFMS) and in examples of LGFMS with relapses showing SEF 
morphology, it appears that EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements predominate over 
FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements among "pure" SEF tumors. Recent information about 
SEF is briefly reviewed.

Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (sRMS/scRMS), previously classified as 
a histologic variant of embryonal RMS (ERMS), has been recently defined as a 
distinct pathologic subtype of RMS. Despite a uniform histologic appearance, 
sRMS/scRMS is a heterogeneous group with different outcomes between children and 
adults and distinct genetic abnormalities with either NCOA2 or VGLL2 related 
fusions or MYOD1 mutations. As sRMS/scRMS show a predilection for the head and 
neck, we sought to investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 
this patient population treated at our Institution in the past 2 decades. There 
were 13 patients (8 males and 5 females) with head and neck sRMS/scRMS with a 
mean age at diagnosis of 29 years, including 5 children and 8 adults. The common 
anatomic sites were buccal/masticator space, tongue and mandibular soft tissue. 
Three patients presented with distant metastases. Eight cases had spindle cell 
and five sclerosing morphology. All tumors tested showed diffuse reactivity for 
myoD1. None of the 7 cases tested showed PAX3/7-FOXO1 fusion. Three of the nine 
cases tested harbored MYOD1 with or without PIK3CA mutations, all having 
sclerosing histology and succumbing of disease with recurrences. All except one 
patient with sclerosing RMS died of disease, in contrast to only one of eight 
with spindle cell morphology. The only patient with infantile sRMS/scRMS showed 
an SRF-NCOA2 fusion. All patients except one were treated with multimodality 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or surgery. Our results show that fatal outcome 
in head and neck sRMS/scRMS was associated with adult age, sclerosing 
morphology, and MYOD1 and PIK3CA mutations.

The authors present two cases of primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma 
(SEF) of the kidney. Both patients had a mass in the upper part of the left 
kidney without any primary extrarenal neoplastic lesions. Grossly, the tumors 
were solid masses both measuring 7.5 cm in the greatest diameter. 
Histologically, one of the lesions exhibited a predominantly lobular growth of 
round or oval small uniform epithelioid cells in variable cellularity. Circular 
zones of crowded tumor cells alternating with hypocellular collagenous tissue in 
a concentric fashion around entrapped native renal tubules were distinctive. The 
second case was distinctive with significant cytological atypia in the 
neoplastic cells and prominent reactive proliferations in the trapped renal 
tubules. Immunohistochemically, vimentin, bcl-2 and MUC4 were diffusely positive 
in both. They were negative for S-100 protein, CD34, and desmin, whereas CD99 
were positive in one lesion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay using dual 
staining probes detected EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion in each lesion, which is 
characteristic molecular findings of SEF. One patient presented widespread 
distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. In the other, no tumor deposits 
were detected other than primary. Both patients have been alive with 30 and 
10 month follow-ups, respectively. These tumors are 6th and 7th cases of primary 
renal SEF in the literature confirmed by FISH study, which exhibit unique and 
remarkable histomorphologic features.

We report two cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma occurring in the deep 
soft tissue of the thigh, confirmed by molecular analysis and associated with 
bone metastases in the lumbar vertebrae and the iliac wing at the time of 
diagnosis. Synchronous bone metastases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma 
are extremely difficult to diagnose because clinical and radiological features 
are not specific. In addition, the range of differential diagnoses is very wide, 
including metastatic carcinoma and osteosarcoma. At present, all but three 
published cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma with bone metastases 
showed bone metastases during follow-up. We confirm in our two cases that the 
distinct pattern of immunohistochemical staining for MUC4, associated with the 
absence of staining for both SATB2, a marker of osteoblastic differentiation, 
and pan-cytokeratin, allows differentiating between sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma and metastatic carcinoma or osteosarcoma.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare fibrosarcoma variant with 
specific histomorphology and consistent translocation (EWSR1-CREB3L1/2). To 
date, 110 cases have been reported; only 15 originated within the abdomen. With 
only 2 cases reported parallel to our study and one case briefly mentioned in a 
previous series, primary renal SEF is exceptionally rare but might be 
underrecognized. We herein describe 2 cases affecting a 23-year-old woman and a 
43-year-old man. Tumor size was 22 and 4.2 cm, respectively. Patient 1 developed 
skeletal and multiple pulmonary metastases. She died of disease 82 months later, 
despite aggressive multimodality therapy. Patient 2 has no evidence of 
recurrence or metastasis (8 months after surgery). Histologic examination showed 
similar appearance with monotonous bland medium-sized epithelioid cells with 
rounded slightly vesicular nuclei and clear cytoplasm imparting a carcinoma-like 
appearance set within a highly sclerotic hyaline fibrous stroma. The tumor cells 
were arranged in nests, single cell cords, trabeculae, or solid sheets with 
frequent entrapment of renal tubules and glomeruli. Immunohistochemistry showed 
strong expression of vimentin, bcl2, CD99, and MUC4, whereas cytokeratin and 
other markers were negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a 
translocation involving the EWSR1 gene locus in case 2. Molecular analysis in 
case 1 was not successful due to poor signal quality. To our knowledge, this is 
the second report documenting primary renal SEF. Awareness of this entity would 
help avoid misinterpretation as clear cell carcinoma, sclerosing perivascular 
epithelioid cell tumor, Xp.11 translocation carcinoma, and other more frequent 
neoplasms at this site.

INTRODUCTION: Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign tumours that usually present in 
childhood. Aggressive forms have been described, which are often treated with 
surgery that entails major resection and reconstruction. Polidocanol 
sclerotherapy has recently been reported to have excellent results and promises 
to replace operative treatments, but its efficacy in the case of aggressive 
aneurysmal bone cysts has not been documented.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old woman from Sweden presented with pain in her 
shoulder and a rapidly progressing cystic bone lesion. The differential 
diagnosis was a rare, aggressive form of aneurysmal bone cyst or a sarcoma of 
the proximal humerus. She was successfully treated using sequential percutaneous 
injections of polidocanol after exclusion of malignancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Management of aggressive aneurysmal bone cysts has thus far relied 
on open surgery. We propose that non-operative treatment with polidocanol is 
efficient even in the aggressive form of the aneurysmal bone cyst.

We report the first 2 genetically confirmed cases of primary renal sclerosing 
epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF), occurring in a 17-year-old boy and a 61-year-old 
woman. In both cases, the tumors demonstrated the typical epithelioid clear cell 
morphology associated with extensive hyalinizing fibrosis, raising the 
differential diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor, metanephric stromal tumor, and 
the sclerosing variant of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. Both neoplasms 
demonstrated diffuse immunoreactivity for MUC4, a highly specific marker for 
SEF, and both demonstrated evidence of rearrangement of both the EWSR1 and 
CREB3L1 genes, which have recently been shown to be fused in this entity. Both 
neoplasms presented with metastatic disease. Primary renal SEF represents yet 
another translocation-associated sarcoma now shown to arise primarily in the 
kidney.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare soft tissue tumor exhibiting 
considerable morphologic overlap with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). 
Moreover, both SEF and LGFMS show MUC4 expression by immunohistochemistry. While 
the majority of LGFMS cases are characterized by a FUS-CREB3L1 fusion, both 
FUS-CREB3L2 and EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusions were recently demonstrated in a small 
number of LGFMS and SEF/LGFMS hybrid tumors. In contrast, recent studies pointed 
out that SEF harbor frequent EWSR1 rearrangements, with only a minority of cases 
showing FUS-CREB3L2 fusions. In an effort to further characterize the molecular 
characteristics of pure SEF and hybrid SEF/LGFMS lesions, we undertook a 
clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and genetic analysis of a series of 10 
SEF and 8 hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors. The mortality rate was similar between the 
two groups, 44% within the pure SEF group and 37% in the hybrid SEF/LGFMS with a 
mean overall follow-up of 66 months. All but one pure SEF and all hybrid 
SEF/LGFMS-tested cases showed MUC4 immunoreactivity. The majority (90%) of pure 
SEF cases showed EWSR1 gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
with only one case exhibiting FUS rearrangement. Of the nine EWSR1 positive 
cases, six cases harbored CREB3L1 break-apart, two had CREB3L2 rearrangement (a 
previously unreported finding) and one lacked evidence of CREB3L1/2 
abnormalities. In contrast, all hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors exhibited FUS and 
CREB3L2 rearrangements. These results further demarcate a relative cytogenetic 
dichotomy between pure SEF, often characterized by EWSR1 rearrangements, and 
hybrid SEF/LGFMS, harboring FUS-CREB3L2 fusion; the latter group recapitulating 
the genotype of LGFMS.

Recently, spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) has been recognized as 
another distinct variant of a RMS. We evaluated clinicopathological features of 
21 cases of spindle cell and sclerosing RMS and performed fluorescent in situ 
hybridization (FISH) testing in 10 (47.6%) tumours. Twenty-one tumours occurred 
in 16 males and 5 females (mean age, 19.7 years); commonly in the head and neck 
region (8) (38%) and extremities (7) (33.3%), followed by paratesticular region 
(2) (9.5%), chest wall (1), abdomen (1), pelvis (1) and paraspinal region (1). 
Average tumour size was 7.9 cm. Histopathologically, tumours that were spindle 
cell type (8) (38%) mostly occurred in the head and neck region, while 
sclerosing type (10) (47.6%) mostly occurred in the extremities. Remaining three 
(14.2%) tumours were mixed (sclerosing with spindle cell type). Tumour areas 
resembling embryonal RMS (ERMS) and alveolar RMS (ARMS) were noted in eight and 
three tumours respectively. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were positive 
for desmin (21/21) (100%), MyoD1 (19/19) (100%), myogenin (13/15) (86.6%), SMA 
(2/3) and MIC2 (1/8) (12.5%). On FISH testing, none of the 10 tumours exhibited 
RMS1 (PAX3-FOXO1) or RMS 2 (PAX7-FOXO1) fusion. Eighteen patients underwent 
surgical resection and were offered adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) (4 cases), 
adjuvant CT + radiotherapy (RT) (4 cases) and adjuvant RT (1 case). Two patients 
underwent CT and a single patient received CT + RT. On follow-up (16 cases) 
(2-36 months), six tumours recurred and nine metastasized. Spindle/sclerosing 
RMSs are aggressive tumours and occur commonly in the head and neck and 
extremity sites. These tumours are histopathologically interrelated. Their 
immunohistochemical and cytogenetic profile is closer to ERMS than ARMS.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma 
(LGFMS) are 2 distinct types of sarcoma, with a subset of cases showing 
overlapping morphologic and immunohistochemical features. LGFMS is characterized 
by expression of the MUC4 protein, and about 90% of cases display a distinctive 
FUS-CREB3L2 gene fusion. In addition, SEF is often MUC4 positive, but is 
genetically less well studied. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies 
have shown involvement of the FUS gene in the majority of so-called hybrid 
LGFMS/SEF and in 10% to 25% of sarcomas with pure SEF morphology. In this study, 
we investigated a series of 10 primary tumors showing pure SEF morphology, 4 
cases of LGFMS that at local or distant relapse showed predominant SEF 
morphology, and 1 primary hybrid LGFMS/SEF. All but 1 case showed diffuse 
expression for MUC4. Using FISH, reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction, and/or mRNA sequencing in selected cases, we found recurrent 
EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion transcripts by reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction in 3/10 pure SEF cases and splits and deletions of the EWSR1 and/or 
CREB3L1 genes by FISH in 6 additional cases. All 5 cases of LGFMS with 
progression to SEF morphology or hybrid features had FUS-CREB3L2 fusion 
transcripts. Our results indicate that EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are 
predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, highlighting that 
SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types, with different impacts on patient 
outcome.

The diversity of soft tissue tumours with EWSR1 gene rearrangements: a review.

Many soft tissue sarcomas have chromosomal translocations with resultant 
formation of new fusion genes. Among the genes that can be rearranged, the EWSR1 
gene has been identified as a partner in a wide variety of clinically and 
pathologically diverse sarcomas as well as some non-mesenchymal tumours. The 
former include Ewing sarcoma and similar (Ewing-like) small round cell sarcomas, 
desmoplastic small round cell tumour, myxoid liposarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid 
chondrosarcoma, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, clear cell sarcoma of soft 
tissue and clear cell sarcoma-like tumours of the gastrointestinal tract, 
primary pulmonary myxoid sarcoma, extrasalivary myoepithelial tumours and 
sporadic examples of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma and mesothelioma. EWSR1 is a 'promiscuous' gene that can fuse with 
many different partner genes, but sometimes this results in phenotypically 
identical tumours. EWSR1 can, conversely, partner with the same genes in 
morphologically and behaviourally different neoplasms. This paper reviews the 
diversity of the several soft tissue tumour types that are associated with 
rearrangement of the EWSR1 gene.

Adult fibrosarcoma, defined by the World Health Organization as a 'malignant 
neoplasm composed of fibroblasts with variable collagen production and, in 
classical cases, a "herringbone" architecture', is a very rare soft tissue 
sarcoma. Once considered the most common adult sarcoma, the incidence of adult 
fibrosarcoma has declined dramatically over the past several decades. This is 
due to (i) evolution in the classification of soft tissue tumours (ii) 
recognition of clinically, morphologically and genetically distinctive subtypes 
of fibrosarcoma and (iii) increased understanding of the many other mesenchymal 
and non-mesenchymal tumours that may mimic fibrosarcoma. This review article 
will summarize the current state of our knowledge about strictly defined adult 
fibrosarcoma and discuss important entities in its differential diagnosis, 
including various fibrosarcoma variants, monophasic synovial sarcoma and other 
potential mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal mimics.

Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) has been the subject of 
recent reports describing morphologic variants (adamantinoma-like, large cell, 
spindle cell, sclerosing, clear cell, and vascular-like) of the most classic 
form, as well as cases displaying unusual morphologic differentiation and 
atypical immunohistochemical features. We report a case of an uncommon lung 
tumor in a 20-year-old female, morphologically and molecularly consistent with 
an Ewing's sarcoma/PNET tumor with foci of squamous differentiation, and 
peculiar expression of vimentin, high-molecular-weight keratins, p63, 
synaptophysin, and chromogranin. This case raises a challenging differential 
diagnostic problem with therapeutic implications: Should the patient be treated 
following the protocols for Ewing's sarcoma/PNET tumors or as for lung carcinoma 
with neuroendocrine features? The patient we report here was treated with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma/PNET according to Euro Ewing 99 
study protocol followed by surgery and has no evidence of disease 15 months 
after the initial diagnosis. This highlights the importance of achieving the 
correct diagnosis of these atypical tumors using all clinical, morphological, 
and ancillary methods available to allow for their correct and timely treatment.

Cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs) are hepatobiliary cancers with features of 
cholangiocyte differentiation; they can be classified anatomically as 
intrahepatic CCA (iCCA), perihilar CCA (pCCA), or distal CCA. These subtypes 
differ not only in their anatomic location, but in epidemiology, origin, 
etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment. The incidence and mortality of iCCA has 
been increasing over the past 3 decades, and only a low percentage of patients 
survive until 5 years after diagnosis. Geographic variations in the incidence of 
CCA are related to variations in risk factors. Changes in oncogene and 
inflammatory signaling pathways, as well as genetic and epigenetic alterations 
and chromosome aberrations, have been shown to contribute to the development of 
CCA. Furthermore, CCAs are surrounded by a dense stroma that contains many 
cancer-associated fibroblasts, which promotes their progression. We have gained 
a better understanding of the imaging characteristics of iCCAs and have 
developed advanced cytologic techniques to detect pCCAs. Patients with iCCAs 
usually are treated surgically, whereas liver transplantation after neoadjuvant 
chemoradiation is an option for a subset of patients with pCCAs. We review 
recent developments in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of 
CCA, along with advances in classification, diagnosis, and treatment.

A rare sclerosing variant of rhabdomyosarcoma characterized by prominent 
hyalinization and pseudovascular pattern has recently been described as a 
subtype biologically distinct from embryonal, alveolar, and pleomorphic forms. 
We present cytogenetic and molecular findings as well as experimental studies of 
an unusual case of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma. The primary lesion arose within 
the plantar subcutaneous tissue of the left foot of an otherwise healthy 
23-year-old male who eventually developed pulmonary nodules despite systemic 
chemotherapy. Two genetic abnormalities identified in surgical and/or autopsy 
samples of the tumor were introduced into 10T1/2 murine fibroblasts to determine 
whether these genetic changes cooperatively facilitated transformation and 
growth. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a complex abnormal hyperdiploid clone, and 
MDM2 gene amplification was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. 
Cancer gene mutation screening using a combination of multiplexed PCR and mass 
spectroscopy revealed a PIK3CA exon 20 H1047R mutation in the primary tumor, 
lung metastasis, and liver metastasis. However, this mutation was not 
cooperative with MDM2 overexpression in experimental assays for transformation 
or growth. Nevertheless, MDM2 and PIK3CA are genes worthy of further 
investigation in patients with sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma and might be 
considered in the enrollment of these patients into clinical trials of targeted 
therapeutics.

Sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma is a unique rhabdomyosarcoma variant, characterized 
by a prominent hyalinizing matrix. A notable pitfall is the potential for the 
unusual matrix and often pseudovascular growth pattern of this lesion to lead to 
confusion with other sarcoma types, including osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and 
angiosarcoma. Here we report a case of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma arising in a 
40-year old male. The tumor was centered in the pterygomaxillary fossa with 
extensive infiltration into adjacent structures. Fine needle aspiration yielded 
a preliminary diagnosis of high-grade pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, for 
which he received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical resection. Microscopic 
examination showed a malignant spindled to round cell neoplasm with prominent 
osteoid-like, hyaline stroma. Focal rhabdomyoblastic differentiation and diffuse 
immunoreactivity for desmin and myogenin aided in diagnosis. Nineteen months 
status post primary resection, the patient expired with multiple lung and bony 
metastases. Among 39 cases reported thus far (including the present case), there 
is a broad age range (0.3-79 years), with an average age at presentation of 
27 years. The most commonly involved sites are the extremities (n = 19) and head 
and neck (n = 15). Most cases have been treated by resection, often combined 
with radiation and/or chemotherapy. Out of 31 cases with follow-up information 
provided, 6 patients developed local recurrence, 7 patients developed regional 
or distant metastasis, and 5 patients died of disease. Herein we discuss the 
ongoing controversy regarding how sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma might best fit 
into existing rhabdomyosarcoma classification schemes, based upon current 
clinicopathologic and molecular genetic evidence.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare aggressive fibroblastic 
neoplasm composed of cords of epithelioid cells embedded in a dense collagenous 
stroma. The reported immunophenotype of SEF is nonspecific. Some SEF cases show 
morphologic and molecular overlap with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), 
suggesting a relationship between these tumor types. MUC4 has recently been 
identified as a sensitive and specific marker for LGFMS; MUC4 expression was 
also observed in 2 tumors with hybrid features of SEF and LGFMS. We investigated 
MUC4 expression in SEF and other epithelioid soft tissue tumors to determine (1) 
the potential diagnostic utility of MUC4 for SEF and (2) the association between 
MUC4 expression and FUS rearrangement in SEF. Whole sections of 180 tumors were 
evaluated: 41 cases of SEF (including 29 "pure" SEF and 12 hybrid LGFMS-SEF), 20 
epithelioid sarcomas, 11 clear cell sarcomas, 11 metastatic melanomas, 10 
perivascular epithelioid cell tumors, 10 alveolar soft part sarcomas, 10 
epithelioid angiosarcomas, 10 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, 10 epithelioid 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 10 myoepithelial carcinomas, 17 ossifying 
fibromyxoid tumors, 10 leiomyosarcomas, and 10 biphasic synovial sarcomas. 
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed after antigen retrieval using a mouse 
anti-MUC4 monoclonal antibody. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was 
performed on 33 SEF cases using FUS break-apart probes. A subset of cases was 
also evaluated for EWSR1 and CREB3L2/L1 rearrangements by FISH. Strong diffuse 
cytoplasmic staining for MUC4 was observed in 32 of 41 (78%) cases of SEF, 
including all 12 hybrid tumors. FUS rearrangement was detected in 8 of 21 (38%) 
MUC4-positive cases of SEF with successful FISH studies. The prevalence of FUS 
rearrangement was similar in hybrid LGFMS-SEF (2 of 6; 33%) and SEF without an 
LGFMS component (6 of 15; 40%). FUS rearrangement was not detected in any cases 
of MUC4-negative SEF. Two hybrid tumors had both EWSR1 and CREB3L1 
rearrangements. MUC4 expression was also seen in 9 of 10 (90%) biphasic synovial 
sarcomas, predominantly in the glandular component. All other tumor types were 
negative for MUC4, apart from focal reactivity in 5 ossifying fibromyxoid 
tumors, 2 epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and 1 myoepithelial 
carcinoma. MUC4 is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for SEF among 
epithelioid soft tissue tumors. MUC4 expression occurs more frequently than FUS 
rearrangement in SEF. The finding of EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements in 2 cases 
of hybrid LGFMS-SEF suggests that SEFs are genetically heterogenous. 
MUC4-positive SEFs with FUS rearrangement are likely closely related to LGFMS. 
MUC4-positive SEFs that lack FUS rearrangement may be related to LGFMS but could 
have alternate fusion partners, including EWSR1. SEF without MUC4 expression may 
represent a distinct group of tumors. MUC4 expression correlates with glandular 
epithelial differentiation in biphasic synovial sarcoma and is very limited in 
other epithelioid soft tissue tumors.

Several recent reports have described low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma with 
sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like areas. We evaluated cases of pure 
sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma lacking areas of low-grade fibromyxoid 
sarcoma for FUS rearrangement to determine whether this entity could be related 
to low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. Available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
tissue of 27 sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma from 25 patients was retrieved 
and tabulated with clinical information. Unstained slides from formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded blocks were prepared and fluorescence in-situ hybridization 
was performed using a commercial FUS break-apart probe. The median patient age 
at presentation was 50 (range, 14-78) years, with 14 males and 10 females. 
Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma most commonly involved the extremities (n=8) 
or chest (n=6). Sixteen patients had a median follow-up of 17 (range, 1-99) 
months; seven were alive and well at 12 (range, 5-30) months; three alive with 
disease at 28 (range, 9-99) months; five dead of disease at a median of 22 
(range, 1-36) months and one was dead of unknown causes. Twelve patients were 
known to have metastases; the most common site was lung (n=7), followed by bone 
(n=3), lymph nodes (n=2) and peritoneum (n=1). Only 2 of 22 (9%) analyzable 
cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma showed rearrangement in the FUS 
locus by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Although cytogenetically confirmed 
low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma can have sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like 
areas, FUS rearrangement, which is characteristic of low-grade fibromyxoid 
sarcoma, appears to be relatively rare in pure sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare but distinct variant of 
fibrosarcoma. A 43-year-old man presented with a lesion in his back that had 
been present for three years but had recently increased in size. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 6-cm sized ovoid mass showing low intensities 
on T1 and T2 weighted images. Histologically, the tumor was of moderate 
cellularity, and the cells were relatively uniform in size and shape. The cells 
were epithelioid, round, oval and polygonal with clear and slightly eosinophilic 
cytoplasm, forming nests, cords, or sheet-like patterns with a dense collagenous 
and hyalinized matrix. The tumor was positive for vimentin, but negative for 
smooth muscle actin, desmin, HMB45, and CD34. Although the tumor showed nuclear 
overexpression of beta-catenin protein, the CTNNB1 exon3 mutation was not 
detected. Fluorescent in situ hybridization for FUS using dual color break-apart 
probes showed rearrangement of the FUS. In accordance with previous studies, our 
case showed positive findings of FUS rearrangement, reinforcing the notion of a 
close relationship between low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and SEF.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) rarely occurs outside the somatic soft 
tissue. Until recently no consistently specific genetic alteration had been 
associated with SEF. Molecular testing of the FUS gene rearrangement involving 
chromosome 16 [at one time considered specific for low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma 
(LGFMS) and its variant, LGFMS with giant collagen rosettes), may be a nonrandom 
abnormality in some cases of SEF.We present an example of a rare FUS-positive 
SEF that arose in the floor of mouth of a 56 year old male. Light microscopy, 
exhaustive immunohistology, and FISH examination showing chromosome 
rearrangement using the FUS break-apart probe led to an erroneous diagnosis of 
LGFMS with giant collagen rosettes. An outside expert agreed with that diagnosis 
citing the FISH results as confirmatory. Upon review almost 2 years later after 
local recurrence, the classic histopathologic features of SEF were noted 
instead. This example suggests that at least a subset if not most examples of 
SEF are part of the LGFMS "family" of neoplasms, and reiterates the value of 
careful histologic examination in an age of increasingly sophisticated and 
presumably specific molecular results.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma was first described more than 20 years ago. 
Subsequently, it was discovered to carry the recurrent chromosomal translocation 
t(7;16)(q33;p11) encoding a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion oncoprotein. Molecular tests for 
this pathognomonic gene fusion can confirm the identity of histologic variants 
(such as hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes) and suggest that 
some cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma may represent a high-grade 
version of this entity. We present a case of an ossifying tumor of the perineum 
that required an open biopsy and fluorescent in situ hybridization testing for 
FUS and CREB3L2 for diagnosis as a variant of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. 
Subsequent excision revealed characteristic areas with collagen rosettes as well 
as foci of heterotopic ossification. Significant ossification, which is well 
documented in entities such as synovial sarcoma, ossifying fibromyxoid tumor, 
and extraskeletal osteosarcoma, has not been reported previously in low-grade 
fibromyxoid sarcoma. This case demonstrates the value of having a distinctive 
confirmatory molecular pathology test for diagnosis and expands our knowledge of 
the histologic variants possible in low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is a distinctive fibroblastic neoplasm 
that is characterized by alternating collagenous and myxoid areas, deceptively 
bland spindle cell morphology, a whorling architecture, and a t(7;16) 
translocation involving FUS and CREB3L2. Owing to variable morphology and a lack 
of discriminatory markers, LGFMS can be difficult to distinguish from benign 
mesenchymal tumors and other low-grade sarcomas. Gene expression profiling has 
identified differential upregulation of the mucin 4 (MUC4) gene in LGFMS 
compared with histologically similar tumors. MUC4 is a transmembrane 
glycoprotein that functions in cell growth signaling pathways; aberrant MUC4 
expression has been reported in various carcinomas. We investigated MUC4 protein 
expression by immunohistochemistry in LGFMS and in other soft tissue tumors to 
determine the potential diagnostic use of this novel marker. Whole-tissue 
sections of 309 tumors were evaluated: 49 LGFMSs (all with FUS gene 
rearrangement confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization), 40 soft tissue 
perineuriomas, 40 myxofibrosarcomas, 20 cellular myxomas, 20 solitary fibrous 
tumors, 20 low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 20 cases of 
desmoid fibromatosis, 20 neurofibromas, 20 schwannomas, 20 monophasic synovial 
sarcomas, 20 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 10 myxoid liposarcomas, 
and 10 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas. The LGFMS cases included 7 with 
marked hypercellularity, 4 with prominent hemangiopericytoma-like vessels, 3 
with giant collagen rosettes, 3 with epithelioid morphology, 2 with focal 
nuclear pleomorphism, and 2 with areas of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. 
All 49 LGFMS cases (100%) showed cytoplasmic staining for MUC4, which was 
usually diffuse and intense. All the other tumor types were negative for MUC4, 
apart from 6 (30%) monophasic synovial sarcomas. In conclusion, MUC4 is a highly 
sensitive and quite specific immunohistochemical marker for LGFMS, and can be 
helpful to distinguish this tumor type from histologic mimics.

single institution over a 48-year period.

Adult-type fibrosarcoma (FS) was once considered the most common adult sarcoma, 
but is now considered a diagnosis of exclusion. No recent series has critically 
reevaluated putative FSs to estimate their true incidence. One hundred 
ninety-five cases diagnosed as adult FS in somatic soft tissue were retrieved 
from our institutional archives for the period 1960 to 2008. Thirty-two cases 
with insufficient material were excluded. On the basis the morphology of the 
final 163 cases, immunohistochemical studies (IHC) was conducted using some 
combination of: wide-spectrum cytokeratin (CK), EMA, high molecular weight CK, 
S100, Melan A, HMB-45, CD34, TLE1, CD31, HHV8, smooth muscle actin, desmin, 
ALK1, CD99, Myo-D1, myogenin, c-kit, INI1, CD21, p63, calretinin, WT1, and TTF1. 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for SYT gene rearrangement was done 
in 6 putative CK-negative synovial sarcomas (SS). Revised diagnoses were based 
on clinical, morphologic, IHC, and molecular findings. The original group of 
putative FS occurred in 84 males and 79 females (median 52.5 y, range 2 to 
99 y), and involved various anatomic sites. Only 26 cases met WHO criteria for 
FS, including 2 postradiation FS. These occurred in 16 males and 10 females 
(median 50 y, range 6 to 74 y), and involved the lower extremities (12 cases), 
head/ neck (5 cases), trunk (4 cases), upper extremities (3 case), and 
mediastinum/abdomen (2 cases). Clinical follow-up information was available for 
24 of 26 (92%) cases, with a median of 5 years follow-up (range <1 to 35 y). 
Twelve patients (50%) died of locally aggressive and/or metastatic disease 
(median follow-up 1-year; range <1 to 8 y), 6 patients (25%) were alive without 
disease (median follow-up 11.5 y; range 2.5 to 35 y), and 6 patients (25%) died 
of other causes (median follow-up 10 y; range 9 to 18 y) (). Fluorescence in 
situ hybridization analysis was positive for SYT gene rearrangement in all cases 
tested. Non-FS (137 cases) were reclassified as: undifferentiated pleomorphic 
sarcoma (32 cases), SS (21 cases), solitary fibrous tumor (14 cases), 
myxofibrosarcoma (11 cases), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (8 cases), 
FS dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and desmoplastic melanoma (4 cases each), 
low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, spindle-cell liposarcoma (3 cases 
each), sclerosing epithelioid FS, fibroma-like epithelioid sarcoma, 
leiomyosarcoma, cellular fibrous histiocytoma (2 cases each), and others (17 
cases). Using modern diagnostic criteria with ancillary IHC and molecular 
genetics, we have been able to reclassify 84% of putative FS. Exclusive of 
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the distinction of which from FS is 
subjective, 64% of putative FS were reclassified, most commonly as monophasic SS 
and solitary fibrous tumor. We conclude that true FS is exceedingly rare, 
accounting for <1% of approximately 10,000 adult soft tissue sarcomas seen at 
our institution during this time period, and should be diagnosed with great 
caution.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma. 
Recently, a link has been suggested between SEF and low-grade fibromyxoid 
sarcoma (LGFMS) on the basis of the finding of the characteristic translocation 
t(7;16) (FUS-CREB3L2) of LGFMS in a small number of studied cases of SEF. The 
frequency of this translocation in SEF is still unknown. We present 2 cases of 
SEF with cytogenetic analysis for FUS rearrangement. The tumors occurred in 12 
and 58 year old patients, respectively and consisted of a well to partially 
circumscribed, non-encapsulated mass, comprising monomorphic, polygonal cells 
arranged in aggregates, cords and single file arrays in a variably sclerotic 
stroma. The cells exhibited minimal nuclear atypia with moderate amount of clear 
to eosinophilic cytoplasm and rare mitotic figures. One case also showed bland 
spindle cell areas with myxoid change, as seen in LGFMS. By immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), the tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin, focally for S-100 
in 1 case and negative for cytokeratin (CK), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), 
HMB-45, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), H-caldesmon, Myo D-1, CD34 and CD 
168. By fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique, the case with mixed 
SEF and LGFMS histology was positive for FUS rearrangement. Our study reinforces 
the previously reported relationship between SEF and LGFMS, and suggests that 
SEF may represent a variant of LGFMS in at least some cases, rather than an 
entirely distinct fibrosarcoma variant.

Sclerosing extramedullary hematopoietic tumor has been described as a rare 
manifestation of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. The lack of knowledge 
about this entity has caused it to be mistaken for many types of 
nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic tumors. We present the case of a 71-year-old 
lady with a long history of primary myelofibrosis, which developed multiple 
abdominal sclerosing extramedullary hematopoietic tumors with good clinical 
evolution. Nonchronic myeloid leukemia myeloproliferative neoplasm included a 
JAK2 mutation as part of the diagnosis algorithm. Particularly, idiopathic 
myelofibrosis is related with a JAK2 mutation in 50% of the cases with a 
pejorative prognosis. The absence of JAK2 demonstrated in the paraffin samples 
of the tumors may be related to the unusual evolution in this particular case. 
Morphologically differential diagnoses considered in the evaluation of this 
entity and in our case included sarcomas mainly liposarcoma, anaplastic 
carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma.

INTRODUCTION: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma is a rare but distinct variant 
of fibrosarcoma that not only presents as a deep-seated mass on the limbs and 
neck but can also occur adjacent to the fascia or peritoneum, as well as the 
trunk and spine. We report the case of an intra-abdominal sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma, which to best of the authors' knowledge has not been described 
previously. The patient discussed here developed lung metastases but is still 
alive 1-year post-diagnosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of 
progressive abdominal distension and pain and was found to have marked ascites. 
A full liver screen was unremarkable with abdominal and chest computed 
tomography scans only confirming ascites. After a diagnostic laparotomy, 
biopsies were taken from the greater omentum and peritoneal nodules. 
Histopathology revealed a malignant tumour composed of sheets and cords of small 
round cells set in collagenized stroma. After further molecular investigation at 
the Mayo Clinic, USA, the diagnosis of a high-grade sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma was confirmed.
CONCLUSION: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma is an extremely rare tumour, 
which is often difficult to diagnose and which few pathologists have 
encountered. This case is particularly unusual because of the intra-abdominal 
origin of the tumour. Owing to the rarity of sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma, there is no clear evidence regarding the prognosis of such a 
tumour, although sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma is able to metastasize many 
years post-presentation. It is important that physicians and pathologists are 
aware of this unusual tumour.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) frequently presents as a multifocal process. 
To study the importance of separating independent primary (IP) from intrathyroid 
metastatic (ITM) PTC, we examined 19 molecular markers on 42 separate tumors 
from 18 multifocal PTC cases. In 12 of 18 (66.7%) cases, including 6 of 12 (50%) 
papillary microcarcinoma cases, the same or similar profile of loss of 
heterozygosities (LOH) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) 
mutation was demonstrated, indicating that they were from the same primary and 
represented ITM. Different profiles of LOHs and BRAF mutation were detected in 
separate tumors of 6 of 18 cases, indicating that they represented IP. Patients 
with ITM, including papillary microcarcinoma, had significantly increased lymph 
node metastasis. The frequencies of LOHs of 17q21, 17p13, 10q23, and 22q13 were 
higher in tumors with lymph node metastasis, suggesting that these LOHs may be 
important in increased lymph node metastasis. LOH of 9p21 was found at the 
highest frequency in PTC (53.8%), followed by 1p36 (46.2%), 10q23 (34.6%), and 
22q13 (34.6%). Papillary microcarcinoma had acquired similar genomic mutations 
as conventional PTC, but higher frequencies of mutations of BRAF, 1p36, 18q, and 
22q13 were found in the larger PTC, suggesting that they might play a role in 
the aggressiveness of PTC. Different profiles of mutations were observed in 
conventional, follicular variants, and diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC, which 
might influence the different morphological appearances and clinical courses. In 
conclusion, molecular analysis can separate multifocal IP PTC from ITM PTC, and 
may be more important than tumor size in predicting lymph node metastasis, 
aggressiveness, and prognosis of PTC.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (LGFMS) bear either the t(7,16) (q32-34;p11) or 
t(11,16) (p11;p11) translocations, resulting in FUS-CREB3L2 or FUS-CREB3L1 
fusions, respectively. Heretofore, fusion transcripts were mainly detected in 
frozen tissues, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In this 
study, we aimed to develop a reliable method to detect these in 
paraffin-embedded tissues, and to examine the clinicopathologic characteristics 
of a series of translocation-positive LGFMS. Sixty-three neoplasms with typical 
morphologic features of LGFMS and 66 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their 
resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors) were examined. RNA of sufficient 
quality could be extracted from 111/129 (86%) cases (59 LGFMS, 52 non-LGFMS). Of 
all, 48/59 (sensitivity, 81%) LGFMS contained detectable transcripts (45 
FUS-CREB3L2, 3 FUS-CREB3L1). Most relevant clinicopathologic features of 
fusion-positive LGFMS included predominance in lower extremities (22/48; thigh: 
13/48), deep situation (46/48), and occasional presence of unusual histologic 
features, for example, hypercellular areas (16/48), foci of epithelioid cells 
(13/48), and giant rosettes (6/48). Most tumors expressed EMA (41/45), at least 
focally, CD99 (38/41) and bcl-2 (36/41) while being essentially negative for 
CD34 (2/45), mdm2 (1/41), smooth muscle actin (1/45), S100 protein (0/46), 
desmin (0/44), h-caldesmon (0/42), keratins (0/44), and CD117 (0/40). Eleven 
presumed LGFMS were fusion negative. Of all, 7/52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained 
FUS-CREB3L2 transcripts, of which 4 had been diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcoma. In conclusion, FUS-CREB3L1/L2 fusion transcripts can be detected 
in paraffin-embedded LGFMS in a sensitive manner, using reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Most fusion-positive LGFMS are 
EMA-positive and CD34/S100/smooth muscle actin negative. The presence of 
epithelioid cells and fusion transcripts in both LGFMS and a subset of 
sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma suggest that these neoplasms might be 
related.

OBJECTIVES: Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is a malignant soft tissue 
tumor. Despite bland histologic features, a significant number of these tumors 
metastasize. We describe the clinicopathologic features of 7 new cases of LGFMS 
including one case of dedifferentiation in a recurrence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 7 cases obtained from the surgical files of the CHUQ, 
L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec or from the consultation files were studied.
RESULTS: The patients' age (5 male and 2 female) ranged from 16 to 55 years old. 
The tumors were located in the thigh (4), the deltoid muscle (2) and in the 
mesentery (1). They measured from 2.3 to 15 cm (greatest diameter). 
Histologically, the tumors were characteristically more fibrous than myxoid. 
Tumors cells were bland, oval to spindle shape, and arranged, at least in part, 
in a storiform or whorled growth pattern. Cellularity was most prominent in 
fibrous areas and there were small, sometimes curvilinear vessels in the myxoid 
areas. Mitotic figures were uncommon. Follow-up of patients ranged from 3 (1/2) 
months to 22 years. Four patients showed recurrence. One of them demonstrated an 
area of dedifferentiation into a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma, malignant 
fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) type. The same patient also had a pulmonary 
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Differential diagnosis of LGFMS should include intramuscular myxoma, 
myxoid liposarcoma, myxoid variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and low 
grade myxofibrosarcoma. The chimeric FUS/CREB3L2 gene seems to be specific for 
LGFMS and its expression in the t(7;16)(q33p11) is a useful tool for the 
differential diagnosis. We report a unique case with areas of high grade 
sarcoma, MFH type, and areas similar to sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma.

From morphological to molecular diagnosis of soft tissue tumors.

Cytogenetic discoveries of balanced translocations in soft tissue tumors have 
opened the way to molecular genetic definition of these translocations as gene 
fusions from the late 1980s. Many sarcomas are known to have such fusions, and 
the demonstration of the fusion transcripts in tumor tissue is of great value in 
specific diagnosis of synovial sarcoma (SYT-SSX), Ewing sarcoma (EWS-Fli1), 
clear cell sarcoma (EWS-ATF1), myxoid liposarcoma (FUS-CHOP), and other 
sarcomas. These translocations are believed to be disease-specific and 
pathogenetic forces, despite occasional observations to the contrary. 
Demonstration of SYT-SSX and EWS-ATF1 fusion assists in the diagnosis of 
synovial and clear cell sarcomas in unusual locations, such as the 
gastrointestinal tract, where these tumors occur with low frequency. 
Demonstration of sarcoma translocations and their fusion by different assays is 
well established; use of in situ hybridization is limited by availability of 
specific probes. In two exceptional instances, the same translocation and gene 
fusion occurs in two unrelated diseases: ETV6-NTRK fusion in infantile 
fibrosarcoma and secretory carcinoma of the breast, and ALK-TPM3 fusion in 
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and large cell anaplastic lymphoma. Thus, the 
target cell of the genetic change is an important factor to define the resulting 
disease. Activating mutations in two related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), 
KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) is central to 
the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and countering the 
mutational activation by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Imatinib 
mesylate, is now standard treatment for metastatic GISTs. KIT exon 11 mutations 
(in frame deletions, point mutations, and duplications) occur in GISTs of all 
locations, whereas a characteristic exon 9 insertion-duplication AY502-503 is 
nearly specific for intestinal vs gastric tumors. In contrast, PDGFRA mutations 
are nearly specific for gastric GISTs, especially those with epithelioid 
morphology. Mutation type influences therapy responsiveness, but fortunately 
very few GISTs carry primarily Imatinib-resistant mutations. Secondary drug 
resistance acquired during Imatinib treatment based on new, Imatinib-resistant 
mutations is a major problem limiting treatment success. Loss of NF2 tumor 
suppressor gene in a biallelic fashion is believed to be central in the 
pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) associated and sporadic schwannomas 
and meningiomas. The mechanism includes nonsense or missense mutation in NF2 
gene, and loss of the other NF2 allele as a part of losses in chromosome 22q. 
Schwannoma types may differ in their pathogenesis: gastrointestinal schwannomas 
lack NF2 changes suggesting a different pathogenesis. Intraneural and sclerosing 
perineuriomas display similar NF2 gene alterations as seen in meningioma, 
indicating a similar pathogenesis and molecular homology. Specific viral 
sequences of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) are diagnostic markers for Kaposi 
sarcoma (KS), and are absent in angiosarcoma. Despite discovery on simian virus 
SV40 sequences in mesothelioma as a possible pathogenetic factor, recent studies 
suggest that the presence of these sequences may be artifactual and based on 
common presence of some SV40 sequences as PCR contaminants.

More than 85% of Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/PNET), or 
"Ewing family of tumors" (EFTs), have the translocation, t (11;22) (q24;q12), 
with others having variant translocations. Identification of these by 
cytogenetic and/or molecular genetic techniques is specific for EFT and is 
increasingly recognized as the "gold standard" for diagnosis. However, these 
techniques are not universally available. We therefore studied a large group of 
genetically confirmed EFTs to more completely understand the morphologic and 
immunophenotypic spectrum of this rare sarcoma. Sixty-six cytogenetically, FISH 
or RT-PCR proven-EFTs were retrieved. In 56 cases, immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
was performed for pan-cytokeratins (PanCK), high molecular weight cytokeratins 
(HMWCK), desmin (DES), CD99, CD117, and FLI1 protein using heat-induced epitope 
retrieval and the Dako Envision system. The cases arose chiefly in children and 
young adults (median 18 years; range, 3-65 years) of both sexes (male, 32; 
female, 31; unknown, 3) in a variety of bone (N = 39) and soft tissue (N = 27) 
sites. Histologically, 46 cases (73%) showed only typical features of ES, 9 
cases (16%) showed features of PNET, 3 cases (5%) showed "adamantinoma-like" 
features, 3 cases (5%) corresponded to "atypical Ewing sarcoma," 3 cases (5%) 
showed principally intersecting fascicles of spindled cells, and 2 cases had 
abundant hyalinized matrix. IHC results were as follows: PanCK (18 of 56, 32%), 
HMWCK (3 of 55, 5%), DES (1 of 56, 2%), CD99 (52 of 52, 100%), CD117 (13 of 54, 
24%), and FLI1 (44 of 47, 94%). HMWCK was expressed only in "adamantinoma-like" 
EFTs, none of which expressed DES. In conclusion, most, but not all, EFTs can be 
accurately diagnosed using time-honored morphologic criteria and ancillary 
immunohistochemistry. However, genetic confirmation remains essential for the 
diagnosis of unusual morphologic variants of EFT, including "adamantinoma-like," 
spindled, sclerosing, and clear cell/anaplastic variants. Therefore, to exclude 
or confirm the diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma in round cell sarcomas having a 
variety of patterns but not specifically conforming to a tumor of known lineage 
(eg, rhabdomyosarcoma), cytogenetics, and/or molecular analysis is required.

The second part of this review on the pathology of soft tissue tumors focuses on 
malignant entities of recent description, including the following: soft tissue 
giant cell tumor, inflammatory myxohyaline tumor, inflammatory fibroblastic 
sarcoma, low grade fibromyxoid Evans sarcoma and its variant, the hyalinizing 
spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes, spindle cell liposarcoma, proximal type 
epithelioid sarcoma, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. For each entity, the 
diagnostic criteria, the clinical presentation and the differential diagnosis 
are described. The role of immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology in the 
identification and delineation of these new entities is emphasized.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an extremely rare soft-tissue 
neoplasm. Here, we describe the molecular genetic alterations and histological, 
immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of a primary SEF arising in the 
retroperitoneum. The tumor consisted of uniform small round to ovoid epithelioid 
cells, arranged in nests and cords and surrounded by a prominent hyalinized 
collagenous matrix. The tumor cells expressed only vimentin. Ultrastructurally, 
the tumor cells showed features of fibroblasts, with an abundant rough 
endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Neither p53 gene mutations nor p53 
protein overexpression were detected, but more than 70% of all tumor cells 
showed strong immunoreactivity with murine double minute 2 (MDM2). Our results 
suggest that MDM2 overexpression is likely to play a role in tumorigenesis in 
this lesion in p53-dependent or p53-independent pathways. To our knowledge, the 
present study is the first molecular genetic study of this rare lesion. Further 
studies will be necessary to clarify the molecular basis of tumorigenesis of 
this rare lesion.

Liposarcoma: new entities and evolving concepts.

Dei Tos AP(1).

Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma and accounts for 
approximately 20% of all mesenchymal malignancies. In the last decade, the 
results of several studies have led to the delineation of new variants as well 
as to the introduction of new concepts, mainly as a result of the fruitful 
interactions between genetics and pathology. Spindle cell liposarcoma represents 
an uncommon variant of well-differentiated liposarcoma. It tends to occur in 
adults and often involves the subcutaneous soft tissue. However, from the 
observation of a larger number of cases, the anatomic distribution of spindle 
cell liposarcoma seems to be comparable to that of the other well-differentiated 
liposarcoma subtypes. Spindle cell liposarcoma tends to recur locally and may 
dedifferentiate. Morphologically it is composed of a fairly bland neural-like 
spindle cell proliferation set in a fibrous and/or myxoid background and is 
associated with an atypical lipomatous component. Great debate has been 
generated by the introduction of the term atypical lipoma to emphasize the fact 
that well-differentiated liposarcoma shows risk of local recurrence but no 
potential for metastasis. In our opinion well-differentiated liposarcoma and 
atypical lipoma should be considered synonyms that describe lesions identical 
both morphologically and kayotypically. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma is a 
distinct type of liposarcoma in which transition from low-grade to high-grade 
nonlipogenic morphology within a well-differentiated liposarcoma is observed. 
The transition usually occurs in an abrupt fashion; however, in rare cases it 
can be more gradual. Recently, it also has been proposed that dedifferentiated 
liposarcoma should be further classified into low and high grade. 
Dedifferentiated liposarcoma rarely exhibits heterologous (most often myoid) 
differentiation. A peculiar "neural-like whorling pattern" of dedifferentiation 
also has been described recently. Surprisingly, the clinical outcome of 
dedifferentiated liposarcoma is less aggressive that in other high-grade 
pleomorphic sarcomas but genetic as well as molecular data exist that may 
partiallyjustify such a discrepancy. Myxoid and round cell liposarcoma, even if 
still classified by the World Health Organization as two distinct subtypes, 
share both clinical and morphologic features. Lesions combining both patterns 
are very frequent and wide agreement exists in considering round cell 
liposarcoma as the high-grade counterpart of myxoid liposarcoma. Furthermore, 
myxoid and round cell liposarcoma share the same characteristic chromosome 
change. Albeit rare, it has been recently shown that liposarcoma indeed can 
occur as a primary skin lesion. It often presents clinically as a dome-shaped or 
polypoid lesion that, histologically, most frequently shows high-grade 
morphologic features but carries a comparatively good prognosis. Considering 
currently available data, the most logical classification of liposarcoma is into 
three main groups: (1) well-differentiated liposarcoma (including adipocytic, 
sclerosing, inflammatory, spindle-cell, and dedifferentiated variants), 
characterized by ring or long markers chromosomes derived from the long arm of 
chromosome 12; (2) myxoid and round cell (poorly differentiated myxoid) 
liposarcoma, characterized in most cases by a reciprocal translocation 
t(12;16)(q13;p11); and (3) pleomorphic liposarcoma, characterized by complex 
karyotypes.

The prototypic soft tissue tumor showing "clear" cytoplasmic features is the 
so-called clear cell sarcoma or malignant melanoma of soft parts, a tumor 
characterized by immunophenotypic and ultrastructural melanogenic 
differentiation and specific cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, ie, 
t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocation and Ewing's sarcoma oncogene/activating 
transcription factor 1 rearrangement. A number of other malignant soft tissue 
tumors occasionally show cytoplasmic clarity, including epithelioid 
leiomyosarcomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and sclerosing 
fibrosarcomas, as well as metastatic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. These 
tumors are discussed in relation to their differential diagnosis with clear cell 
sarcomas.

Major basement membrane components in Kaposi's sarcoma, angiosarcoma and benign 
vascular neogenesis.

Recent cell biologic studies have emphasized the importance of the basement 
membrane (BM) and its molecular components in angiogenesis. We immunostained 60 
angioproliferative lesions (angiosarcoma, sclerosing hemangioma of skin, 
pyogenic granuloma, capillary hemangioma, lymphangioma, glomangioma and 
granulation tissue) and 23 cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) for the major 
macromolecular components laminin, collagen type IV, fibronectin and heparan 
sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Normal structures served as aggregate controls in 
each group, and semiquantitative scoring reflected the degree of consistency of 
staining about blood and lymphatic endothelium and vascular sheath 
(pericyte/smooth muscle) within and peripheral to each lesion. Benign and 
reactive vasoproliferations consistently maintained immunoreactivity for each BM 
component around endothelium and sheath components of blood vessels. 
Angiosarcoma showed from 20 to more than 60% less consistent immunoreactivity by 
comparison, although the score variances were greater than for non-malignant 
lesions. Staining about blood vessel endothelium was both strong and consistent 
among histologic stages in KS with the exception of HSPG, which was weakly 
immunoreactive in all stages. Marked selective HSPG loss was characteristic only 
of KS and normal lymphendothelium, and in the light of evidence for a role for 
HSPG in the assembly and maintenance of BM, suggests that reduced HSPG may be 
responsible for the loss of ultrastructural integrity of perivascular BM in 
both.

Childhood cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cancers of individual organs generally are composed of various 
histologic types, each with its own frequency and demographic patterns. For 
childhood cancers in particular, a classification of cancers by histologic type 
is important for understanding the etiology and progression of the disease.
METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
Program on 9308 microscopically confirmed malignant neoplasms in children 
younger than age 15, newly diagnosed during 1973-1987, were made available for 
analysis. Tumors were grouped histologically according to a classification 
previously utilized in an international volume of childhood cancer incidence.
RESULTS: The most frequent histologic types were acute lymphocytic leukemia 
(23.6%), astrocytoma (9.6%), neuroblastoma (6.6%), and Wilms' tumor (6.4%). 
Acute lymphocytic leukemia accounted for 75% of childhood leukemia. The most 
common form of Hodgkin's disease was the nodular sclerosing subtype, which was 
diagnosed in 56% of all cases. Burkitt's and Burkitt-like disease accounted for 
approximately one third of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the sex ratio (male to 
female) being unusually high (5.7). Among the brain tumors, glioma was of 
interest because 198 cases (excluded from this analysis) were diagnosed without 
histologic confirmation--due, no doubt, to their inaccessibility for biopsy 
because they were located in the brain stem. The most common histologic type of 
soft tissue sarcoma was rhabdomyosarcoma, which accounted for 51% of the total, 
more than half of which were of the embryonal type. To the authors' knowledge, 
this report offers for the first time the relative frequencies of rare types of 
leukemias, such as megakaryoblastic leukemia, in childhood. This report also 
includes the frequencies of 21 rarer forms of soft tissue sarcoma. Five forms of 
childhood cancer had a 5-year relative survival rate of 85% or better. Of the 
cancers with the poorest outcome, three had relative survival rates of 46.5-49%; 
the relative survival rate of acute myelogenous leukemia was only 26.4%. The 
trends in survival over time for 21 types of childhood cancer also are included 
in this report.
CONCLUSIONS: Further refinements in classification now are available through 
laboratory techniques utilizing molecular biology, immunology, and cytogenetics, 
which are of importance in etiologic studies, diagnosis, treatment, and 
prognosis. It would be important in the future for cancer registries to record 
the results of relevant laboratory tests for further analysis by subtype.
